questions,answers
1. How does COVID-19 spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person   to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with   COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.   Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their   eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person   with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than   1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick."
2. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients   may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These   symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but dont   develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the   disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19   becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying   medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to   develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical   attention."
3. How do I know if it is COVID-19 or just the common flu?,"A COVID-19 infection has the same signs and symptoms as the common cold and you can only   differentiate them through laboratory testing to determine the virus type. If you have fever, cough   and difficulty breathing, you should seek medical attention and immediately isolate yourself from   others. Call your local UN clinic/medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant   travel/exposure history. If you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local   Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this. From here you will be advised if a medical   assessment is necessary and how to get tested."
4. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through   contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
5. What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Protection measures for everyone   Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website   and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world   have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some   other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is   unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:   Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them     with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based     hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.   Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or     sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from     their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the     droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.   Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up     viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From     there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.   Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means     covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.     Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following     good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu     and COVID-19.   Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek     medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.     Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the     situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly     direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of     viruses and other infections.   Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is     spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ especially if you are an older     person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching     COVID-19 in one of these areas."
6. I am well and asymptomatic. Should I use a mask?,"According to the WHO, for individuals without respiratory symptoms, a medical mask is not required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons. However, masks might be worn in some countries according to local cultural habits. If masks are used, best practices should be followed on how to wear, remove, and dispose of them and on hand hygiene action after removal. For more information, visit the WHO guidance on use of masks in the community."
7. How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Its important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide. You can see these at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus- 2019/situation-reports/"
8. Are pregnant women more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus and will it harm the       fetus?,"We do not have information from published scientific reports about the susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes, which might make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly by close contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets. Whether a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can transmit the virus that causes COVID-19 to her fetus or neonate by other routes of vertical transmission (before, during, or after delivery) is still unknown."
9. What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on CDCs current Risk Assessment page."
10. Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
11. Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost, among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings."
12. Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
13. Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
14. Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines."
"15. Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus)."
16. Should I wear a mask to protect myself from catching the COVID-19 virus?,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely. WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks). The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information."
17. Until when should I wear a mask after recovering from an illness with respiratory       symptoms?,"In order to avoid infecting others, you should use a mask for as long as you are still coughing or sneezing. You should only stop after a complete recovery (which means 24-48 hours after having no symptoms without medication)."
18. I am looking after someone who is ill with suspect or confirmed COVID-19. What       precautions should I take?,"You should limit the movement around the house of the individual who is ill and           minimize shared space.         Ensure shared spaces like bathrooms, and the kitchen are well ventilated. One way to           do this is by keeping the windows open. Clean and disinfect the bathroom and toilet           surface at least once a day using regular household soap or detergent for cleaning and           then disinfecting with a regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium           hypochlorite.         Do not forget the importance of hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand-rub or soap and           water (if hands are visibly soiled).         Whenever possible, household members should stay in a different room or maintain a           distance of at least 1 meter from the ill person.         When helping care for the sick individual, wear a tightly fitted medical/surgical mask           that covers your nose and mouth when in the same room as the affected individual.           Make sure you are careful not to touch your mask. If your mask gets wet or dirty, it           should be replaced. When removing a mask, it is important to throw it away and           perform hand hygiene. Dispose of any material with respiratory secretions immediately           after use.         Both the ill individual and you, as the caregiver, should perform hand hygiene after           contact with respiratory secretions."
19. How long is the incubation and transmission period for COVID-19?,"The incubation period means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1- 14 days, most commonly around five days."
20. Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
21. How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
22. How can I get tested for COVID-19?,"If you are well, no testing is recommended. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, you should immediately isolate yourself from others. Call your local UN clinic/medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant travel/exposure history. If you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this. From here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested."
23. What alternatives do I have if there are no hand sanitizers available?,"Can I use other       alcohol like ethyl or liquor? If hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is the recommended, and even better, alternative. Liquor is not effective against coronavirus. For an alcohol-based hand rub to be effective, it must have an alcohol content of 60% to 95%."
24. Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again?,"We know that for similar coronaviruses, infected people are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover. However, because the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood, it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients who have recovered from COVID-19."
25. Is it safe to receive a package from an area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
26. Is there a connection between COVID -19 and environment temperature?,"It is not known yet if weather and temperature changes impact or has any connection with COVID-19. At this time, it is not clear or known if the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer."
"27. Can I catch the virus from being in an enclosed space (i.e. bus, subway) in close       proximity to someone who doesn't have respiratory symptoms?","Since the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the risk of catching it from somebody who is asymptomatic, even a contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, is low. However, in light of the pandemic, everyone should maintain social distancing, which means keeping at least 1 meter away from others, avoiding mass gatherings and areas with large numbers of people, and practicing frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing according to the recommendation."
28. Should I start avoiding people of Asian descent and their businesses?,"The virus can affect anyone regardless of nationality, race and color. The Organization will not tolerate discrimination and encourages everyone to promote culturally appropriate and empathetic community engagement and to detect and rapidly respond to negative public perceptions and counter misinformation."
"29. When should we identify ourselves as ""being sick"" and stay at home?","Although a fever is a sure sign that you are sick enough not to come to work, anyone experiencing respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing should stay at home."
30. My colleague is sick but he/she insists that it is just the common cold and is reluctant to work from home. What steps can we take to enforce ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“staying at home when not well amongst staff?,"While it is very likely that your colleague is only suffering from the common cold or flu, all precautions should, nevertheless, be taken. Managers should encourage staff members with flu symptoms to telecommute for some time until the symptoms have abated. Alternatively, if the staff member is feeling unfit, he/she should take sick leave. This is a sensible approach at any time to prevent the spreading of flu or other seasonal viruses. Supervisors are also encouraged to exercise flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements if the staff member would like to limit their contact with others and work from home."
31. What can we do if we don't have any hand sanitizers in the office building?,"You should contact the Facilities Management Service of your local UN duty station, organization or the building administration."
32. What is the process for evaluating the criticality of official travels and meetings?,UN Medical Directors recommend that UN managers and/or UN personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19.
33. Does the UN have any specific guidelines for meeting / mass gathering organizers and      participants during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"   For meetings during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Division of Healthcare Management and      Occupational Safety and Health (DHMOSH) has prepared the following guidelines for      meeting organizers and participants which are available in the UN HR portal. UN offices      should use these global guidelines to develop local ones in accordance with host country      legislation.    The WHO has also released an interim guidance with key planning recommendations for      mass gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak."
34. I plan to travel to / have a meeting in countries or territories currently experiencing      local transmission of COVID-19. Should I cancel this travel/meeting?,"   While the WHO does not recommend and advises against the application of any travel      restrictions based on the information currently available on COVID-19, as an occupational      health measure, it is recommended that for all official travel, UN managers and/or UN      personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel      balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas      experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19. This includes risks posed by both medical      issues and evolving travel/border restrictions enacted by states parties.   Please be aware that local authorities may begin to implement travel restrictions and health     screening measures for travelers entering or exiting the country. All UN personnel who are     planning to travel should check with the destination countries embassy, consulate, or     Ministry of Health and keep up to date with local health advice before and during your     travel. You should also comply with any screening measures put in place by local authorities.   As the outbreak evolves, it can be difficult to predict the situation globally, and it would be     prudent to make contingency arrangements should the need arise. Feel free to consult us     further at dos-dhmosh-public-health@un.org as needed."
"35. What is the protocol for staff members returning to work after visiting COVID-19     affected countries (i.e., those with ongoing transmission)?","  If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for     14 days after travel.   During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention should you develop any     signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough.   Remember to share your previous travel history with your health care provider and make     every effort to inform them by phone prior to visiting a medical facility and wear a medical     mask when you seek medical care.   You should only return to work when you are well and completely free of symptoms.   HR personnel and managers are encouraged to exercise flexibility around remote working to     support staff."
36. I just returned from travel to a country/area experiencing local transmission of     COVID-19. I am well and have no symptoms. Can I go back to the workplace?,"  For any UN personnel who are free of symptoms, and returning from country/area or     territory experiencing local transmission of COVID-19, managers are encouraged to exercise     flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements for staff in these situations who     would like to limit their contact with others and work from home for 14 days post-travel.     This is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged.   Individuals returning from areas of outbreaks should be advised to review our health     advisory on this Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page so that you have awareness about the     disease. You should monitor yourself daily for signs of fever, respiratory symptoms (e.g.,     breathing difficulties, cough), and know where to seek medical attention if you are aware of     any symptoms within yourself. You should monitor yourself for at least 14 days after your     travel."
37. What about self-quarantining after returning from an area/country of high     prevalence?,"  If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for     14 days after travel. During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention     should you develop any signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough.   Self-quarantine for 14 days is recommended when you have been exposed to contact with     lab-confirmed COVID-19.   Since this is a rapidly evolving situation, many member states are imposing quarantine     recommendations for travelers, which varies by country. We suggest monitoring the travel     advisories issued from WHO and DHMOSH for up to date information     https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/travel-advice and     https://hr.un.org/page/travel-health-information"
38. Have medical insurance related questions?,Please refer to Frequently Asked Questions for UN staff on Medical Insurance in connection with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2020- 03-09_faq_medical_insurance_covid-19_ra.pdf
39. What are the latest protocols and guidance for Medical Evacuation of staff members     with severe respiratory infections related to COVID-19?,"   For the latest information on normal Medevac procedure for staff, go to:          https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/Coronavirus_MedevacGuidance_UN_RC_0.pdf        For information on special Medevac procedure organized by the WHO in cases where          there are no ICU beds available in your country, see:          https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/COVID-          MEDEVAC%20UN%20and%20PARTNERS.pdf"
40. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms,"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. "
41. How likely am I to catch COVID-19,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Its important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. "
42. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003."
43. How to put on use take off and dispose of a mask,"Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.2. Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water 3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is). 5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side). 6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose. 7. Pull down the masks bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin. 8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. 9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use. 10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask.  Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water. "
44. How long is the incubation period for COVID-19,"The incubation period means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available. "
45. Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may  then  spread  to  other  people.  For  example,  SARS-CoV  was associated   with   civet   cats   and   MERS-CoV   is   transmitted   by dromedary  camels.  Possible  animal  sources  of  COVID-19  have  not yet been confirmed.   To  protect  yourself,  such  as  when  visiting  live  animal  markets,  avoid direct  contact  with  animals  and  surfaces  in  contact  with  animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
46. Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet,"While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-19 topics and will update as new findings are available."
47. Is there anything I should not do?,"The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful: Smoking Wearing multiple masks Taking antibiotics (See question 10 ""Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?"")"
48. Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?,"It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing."
49. What is community spread?,"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department website.?"
50. Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?,"At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person."
"51. Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, stands for corona virus for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans."
52. Is it okay for me to donate blood?,"In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time."
"53. Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?","There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."
54. Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?,"Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
55. Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?,"Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to?protect yourself and others."
56. How can I prepare for COVID-19 at work?,"Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options."
57. Should I be tested for a current infection?,"Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments and healthcare providers.You can also visit your state or local health department  website to look for the latest local information on testing."
58. What will happen with my personal information during contact tracing?,"Discussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider.If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify people you were in close contact with (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes) that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Each state and jurisdiction use their own method for collecting and protecting health information. To learn more, contact your state or local health department."
59. Who is considered a close contact to someone with COVID-19?,"For COVID-19, a close contact is anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person had any symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19."
60. Am I considered a close contact if I was wearing a mask?,"Yes, you are still considered a close contact even if you were wearing a mask while you were around someone with COVID-19. Masks are meant to protect other people in case you are infected, and not to protect you from becoming infected."
"61. Can I get COVID-19 from food (including restaurant take-out, produce, refrigerated, or packaged food) or drinking water?","Currently there is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 by eating or handling food.It may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, such as a food package or dining ware that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."
62. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through treated drinking water?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in treated drinking water. Water treatment plants use filters and disinfectants to remove or kill germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates water treatment plants to ensure that treated water is safe to drink.Currently, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people by drinking treated water. COVID-19 is spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. You can continue to use and drink water from your tap as usual."
63. Is the virus that causes COVID-19 found in feces (stool)?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)."
64. Can the COVID-19 virus spread through sewerage systems?,"Recently, ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low."
65. Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19?,"Recently, ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater.Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. These standard practices can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19 specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities."
"66. If my utility has issued a Boil Water Advisory, can I still use tap water to wash my hands?","In most cases, it is safe to wash your hands with soap and tap water during a Boil Water Advisory. Follow the guidance from your local public health officials. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol."
67. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in saltwater pools?,"CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, including saltwater pools. Plus, proper operation of public pools (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus. Saltwater pools are chlorinated pools.In traditional pools, chlorine products (such as granules or liquid bleach) are added to the water to disinfect it. In saltwater pools, table salt (made up of sodium and chloride) is added to the water, and an electrical current is then run through the water with dissolved salt. This creates the same disinfecting form of chlorine that is created when chlorine products are added to the water in traditional pools."
