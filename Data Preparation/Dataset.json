            "What does it mean to have a mental illness?",
            "Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life.\nMental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital.\nIt is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biology.\nSimilarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."

            "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background.\nAlthough mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children.\nAdditionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition.\nParents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."

Others may choose to stop taking their medication because of its side effects, without realizing that most side effects can be effectively managed. While it may seem reasonable to stop taking the medication, the problem is that most often, the symptoms will return. If you or your child is taking medication, it is very important that you work together with your doctor before making decisions about any changes in your treatment.\\nAnother problem with stopping medication, particularly for stopping it abruptly, is that you may develop withdrawal symptoms that can be very unpleasant. If you and your doctor feel a trial off your medicine is a good idea, it is necessary to slowly decrease the dosage of medications so that these symptoms don\u2019t occur.\\nIt is important that your doctor and pharmacist work together to make sure your medications are working safely and effectively. You should talk with them about how you are doing and if there are side effects that make you unwilling to continue treatment. They will work with you to develop strategies for minimizing these side effects, or will create a plan for switching to a different treatment that will be a better fit."

This is important for the health of your neighbours and your own mental health, and taking action can help counter difficult feelings like hopelessness and despair. \n One study from people in China found that people who had reliable up-to-date information about the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness and accurate instructions on how they should act (such as instructions around hand-washing and wearing a mask) felt more resilient and felt better able to handle the virus. People who received good, accurate information reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This research is available for free at www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/5/1729. \n Of course, it's okay to set limits. Staying informed does not mean that you have to follow the news all day.

            "Anyone can post anything online. It's up to the readers to think critically about information to decide if it seems helpful, truthful, or safe. Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test. \n It's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source. \n Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. \n Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. \n Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. \n Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? \n Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \"Skyrocketing rates of infection\" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \"We have 50 new cases in BC\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. \n Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? \n Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. \n Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information. \n Visit www.mediasmarts.ca to learn more about digital and media literacy \n Visit www.healthnewsreview.org to learn more about thinking critically around health claims (this resource is no longer updated daily, but all toolkits and lessons are still available) \n This page is adapted from the Evaluating Mental Health and Substance Use Information info sheet."

What you can do is make a plan and decide how you'll manage the things you do control, like your ability to stay safe, follow public health measures, stay connected with loved ones, and take care of your mental and physical health. \n Events like a pandemic change a lot over time, and that uncertainty can add to fear and stress. The truth is that we don't know what will happen next\u2014but that doesn't mean we're all helpless. You can do a lot.

If you anticipate a need, you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of time \n Figure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless, like calming activities, the number for a local support or crisis line, a video chat with a loved one, or a way to connect with your mental health care provider \n Look for local support organizations, neighbourhood groups, or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your community \n Some planning will be straightforward, but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action. This is a great time to practice problem-solving skills. Problem-solving is a method that helps you break down a complicated situation into manageable pieces, look for realistic and unbiased information, brainstorm possible solutions, and test the solutions that you think might work well.

            "A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together. \n While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear. \n Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. \n Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. \n The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. \n Everyone feels lonely at times\u2014maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. \n Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. \n Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections.

            "How can I take care of my physical health?",
            "Taking care of your physical health is also good for your mental health. It's more important than ever to keep yourself healthy. \n Try to eat as well as you can. It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home, but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries, don\u2019t ignore fresh fruit and vegetables\u2014we still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores, this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time. \n If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in self-isolation, reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe, no-contact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries, or look for local COVID-19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus. \n Exercise is an important part of mental health and well-being, stress management, and health sleep. However, it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed. \n If it's safe for you to do so, spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others, but there is no reason to avoid walks, runs, or other safe outdoor activities. (Note that some municipalities, BC Parks, and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds, so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures\u2014they're just keeping everyone safe.) \n If you prefer to exercise indoors, you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga, follow a barre class, work on your cardio, pick up a new dumbbell routine, and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for no-equipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment. \n Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood, your outlook, and your patience. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping, be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits. For more, check out Wellness Module 6: Getting a Good Night's Sleep at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-6-getting-a-good-nights-sleep. \n If you have other health problems like a chronic illness, check in with your doctor or health care team to see if you need to take any additional measures or precautions. Remember to plan ahead and do what you can to keep prescription or over-the-counter medications, medical supplies, supplements, or other health needs on hand."

            "How can I use distraction to manage difficult thoughts or feelings?",
            "Distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated. \n If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project. \n If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more. \n When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family\u2014whoever takes the most language classes wins! \n Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment. This can be a great way to make new connections in your area, and helping others is good for your own mental health. Just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancing\u2014your own health is important."

            "How can I reframe the situation and find more balanced perspectives?",
            "How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours. \n When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it's hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what's going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.) \n People often overestimate the negative parts\u2014their own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself\u2014and underestimate positive parts\u2014their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities. \n How does the thought \"We're never going to make it through this!\" make you feel? It likely doesn't feel good\u2014and it isn't even true. \n Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well. \n Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation? \n Here are a few example: \n \"I'm so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!\" \n \"I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it's rescheduled, I'll enjoy it more because I won't have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.\" \n \"I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.\" \n \"I'm doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It's worth it because it keeps people healthy.\" \n \"I'm having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.\" \n \"I'll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I'm home more, I'll have more time to finish the projects I haven't touched in months and I'm excited to see the end results. \n \"I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now.\" \n \"It makes sense that I feel scared\u2014people are getting sick and we don't know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I'm going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable.\" \n \"We're going to be stuck inside forever. I'm already sick of this.\" \n \"I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal.\" \n The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there's a problem. Instead, this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now."

            "How can I challenge thinking traps?",
            "What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects\u2014this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. \n These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well. \n Here are some common thinking traps: \n Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \"always\" or \"never.\" \n I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it\u2019s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! \n Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. \n I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! \n Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. \n I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! \n Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. \n I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick. \n Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. \n I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. \n Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. \n I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. \n Telling yourself how you \"should\" or \"must\" act. \n I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! \n Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. \n Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. \n This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. \n Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: \n What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. \n What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? \n What are your emotions? How do you feel? \n What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? \n Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. \n The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that: \n Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \"I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. \n Ask yourself, \"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. \n Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \"Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem.\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids. \n Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. \n Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example: \n I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. \n I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this! \n Labeling \n 'Should' statements \n Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. \n It's okay to feel upset right now\u2014there's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. \n Try the Healthy Thinking Worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca \n Check out Anxiety Canada's articles Helpful Thinking and Thinking Traps \n This page is adapted from Wellness Module 8: Healthy Thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking."

            "How can I manage grief?",
            "While a lot of people think of grief in terms of losing a person or pet, grief can come up whenever you lose something important. This includes: \n Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent \n Losing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures \n Losing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19 \n Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolation \n Losing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normal \n Losing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future \n Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings \n Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again. \n Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey. \n Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art. \n Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait. \n Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other. \n Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities. \n Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass. \n Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings, it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellor\u2014many now offer online or phone appointments.

Here are some resources to check out. \n The Antidepressant Skills Workbook was created by two BC psychologists. You\u2019ll learn more about depression, learn and practice different skills to help improve your mood, and learn how healthy changes in other parts of your life can impact your mood.

            "What's the difference between a psychiatrist and a registered psychologist?",
            "A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with extra training in mental health who can choose to prescribe medications. Some use psychotherapy (\u2018talk therapies\u2019) approaches like cognitive-behavioural therapy to treat mental health problems. Many psychiatrists work at hospitals, clinics, or health centres, and some have a private office. As they are specialist doctors, you will almost always need another doctor\u2019s referral to see a psychiatrist, and fees are covered by MSP. If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard, you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist. \n A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments, but they don\u2019t prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to access registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools. You may need a doctor\u2019s referral to access the program, and costs are usually covered by MSP. However, most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this, you can contact the psychologist yourself\u2014you do not need a referral. Costs are not covered by MSP, but they may be covered by employee health plans. A registered psychologist\u2019s fees charged by hour vary, and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes. \n You\u2019ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated. The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear. When it comes to your treatment and care, the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on fine-tuning medications? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach? Does the professional\u2019s philosophy of care make sense to you? Do you like the professional you\u2019re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences? Ultimately, your relationship with the professional is what matters. Instead of focusing on designation, look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations. \n Talk to your family doctor and ask for their recommendations \n Ask local mental health organizations for help. You can find local branches through the provincial organizations behind HeretoHelp \n Ask a community health centre, outpatient psychiatry program, or mental health team for suggestions \n For a list of psychiatrists near you, search under \u2018Specialist\u2019 in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia\u2019s Find a Physician Tool but remember that you will first need a referral from a doctor (like your family doctor) \n For a list of psychologists near you, search in the British Columbia Psychological Association\u2019s Find a Registered Psychologist tool and you can also learn more about finding a psychologist from the College of Psychologists of British Columbia"

            "What's the difference between psychotherapy and counselling?",
            "Psychotherapy and counselling have a lot in common and usually mean the same thing. Both are used to describe professionals who use talk-based approaches to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem. Many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy, including registered psychologists, registered clinical counsellors, psychiatrists, other therapists and counsellors, family doctors, psychiatric nurses, and faith leaders. \n It\u2019s useful to talk to someone about any problem\u2014a lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better. A professional therapist or counsellor can offer more: they have training, experience, and emotional distance (since they don\u2019t know you). They use different theories to listen to you, support you, and approach different problems or patterns. For example, a psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions, well-being, and future thoughts and behaviours. A therapist could help you learn and practice these skills. \n There are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses. A few examples include cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, solutions-focused brief psychotherapy, narrative therapy, and emotion-focused therapy. \n In general, some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same, no matter which approach you choose: the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions, the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapist\u2019s understanding of the problem, and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist. In fact, one research review found that 50% of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor (called non-directive supportive therapy) was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist.1 Psychotherapy can and does work, but the professional you choose, and their match with your values, is also very important. \n When you\u2019re looking for a professional, it\u2019s always a good idea to ask if they are a member of a professional organization (like those listed in the next section)."

            "What's the difference between CBT and DBT?",
            "CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy) and DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) are two forms of psychotherapy or \u201ctalk therapy.\u201d In both, you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you experience and learn skills to help you manage challenges on your own. \n Cognitive-behavioural therapy or CBT teaches you how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours influence each other. For example, if you believe that people don\u2019t like you (thought), you might avoid social situations (behaviour) and feel lonely (feeling). However, CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage: a positive change in one factor (changing a thought or behaviour) can lead to positive changes in all factors. CBT is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and substance use problems. \n CBT is structured, short-term, goal-oriented and focused on the present. It starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you. Next, you\u2019ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problem-solving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. You\u2019ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future. \n Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT is based on CBT, with greater focus on emotional and social aspects. DBT was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours. DBT is an evidence-based approach to help people regulate emotions. It started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder, and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns, particularly self-harm. \n Key differences between CBT and DBT are validation and relationships. DBT teaches you that your experiences are real, and it teaches you how to accept who you are, regardless of challenges or difficult experiences. Relationships are also very important in DBT\u2014including the relationships between you and your DBT practitioner. You may have frequent check-ins to talk about any successes or problems. Treatment may include a mix of one-on-one sessions and group sessions. In addition to CBT skills, you\u2019ll learn skills around managing your emotions, building relationships with others, coping well with problems or distress, acceptance, and mindfulness. \n As with many talk therapies, it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills. But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist, they often find that their new skills and strategies become second nature\u2014they are tools that last a lifetime."

Each class may contain several different medications, which each have slightly different ways of working. Below, you\u2019ll find common classes and examples of common medications. The first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name. \n SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex), and sertraline (Zoloft) \n SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) \n NDRIs or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors: bupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) \n NaSSAs or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants: mirtazapine (Remeron), which can also be classed as a TeCa or tetracyclic antidepressant \n SARIs or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors: trazodone (Desyrel) \n There are other classes of antidepressants (such as MAOIs or triclycics) that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions. They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don\u2019t work. Other medications such as lithium, thyroid medication, or antipsychotics may also be prescribed, often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression\u2014they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders. \n Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants, keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process, especially when you feel unwell, but it\u2019s important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and it\u2019s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first. Everyone responds to them differently. It\u2019s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns\u2014or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works."

That way, the professional can answer your questions and you can better understand their decision. \n If that doesn\u2019t resolve the situation or a follow-up appointment isn\u2019t possible, you can ask for a second opinion.

            "If you\u2019re concerned about your medications, it\u2019s important to talk with the doctor or psychiatrist who prescribed your medications. While it can take a few weeks to really see improvements with many antidepressants, it\u2019s still a good idea to talk to your doctor about what to expect. \n Talk to the doctor that prescribed your medication if you experience symptoms or side effects that are distressing you. If you want to talk to a trusted professional about the most common side effects, call your pharmacist. You can reach a pharmacist by phone after-hours by calling 811. \n It\u2019s also best not to stop taking the medication or changing the dose on your own without first talking to a health care provider. While it might be tempting to stop taking your medication when you start feel better, it\u2019s important to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions. \n In some cases, people can have an allergic reaction to a medication. Some reactions are not serious, like a rash. In these cases, you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help after-hours. If you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing, dizziness, or confusion, call 911 right away. \n When you start a new medication, your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects, signs of an allergic reaction, how long it might take to work, and other information. It\u2019s good information to keep on hand, but it isn\u2019t always easy to read. When you pick up your medication, you can ask the pharmacist to go over the information with you so you understand what you should look for. \n If a particular antidepressant or psychiatric medication just isn\u2019t working for you, there are many different options! Unfortunately, finding the right medication can take some trial and error. Different people can have very different experiences with the same medication, and often you need to try something to see if it works (or doesn\u2019t work) for you. This can be a frustrating process, especially when you want to start feeling better, but it\u2019s important to keep trying and work with your doctor so you understand your options.

If the vast majority of cases, you cannot do this work entirely for them\u2014and trying to do so may damage your relationship. \n Be honest about your concerns, the impacts you are seeing that worry you, listen to their point of view and work together to find a solution that works for everyone, even if it means a compromise. You may want to offer to go with them to an appointment, encourage them to do an online screening self-test, or involve someone else close to them who may be similarly concerned and may have more influence in encouraging them to notice changes and seek help. Because you may be feeling frustrated and helpless, it\u2019s important to get care and support for yourself during this time, especially if you\u2019re very close to the person you\u2019re worried about. \n In serious situations, the BC Mental Health Act allows someone to be held for a period of time for psychiatric assessment without their consent if they are at risk of harming themselves or others. While it\u2019s necessary in some situations to get someone the care they need, it can be traumatic for everyone involved.

            "It can be hard to figure out what to do if you\u2019re concerned about a young person in your family. Many people start by talking with their family doctor. If you don\u2019t have a family doctor, you can find a doctor through the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC. You can also visit a walk-in clinic. Depending on the situation, your family doctor may offer everything you need. If your child needs more specialized services, such as psychiatry services, your family doctor needs to make a referral for your child. Many family doctors can also recommend community services or supports in your community. Learn more about the role of family doctors in the info sheet What to Expect from Your Family or Walk-In Clinic Doctor. \n If your child\u2019s difficulties affect their performance or behaviour at school, the school may be involved. If your child\u2019s school has a counsellor, talk to them about services you can access through the school. School counsellors can also suggest community services.

            "A brain injury itself isn\u2019t the same as a mental illness, though someone who experiences a brain injury may also experience mental health problems. These mental health problems may stem from the injury itself or from thoughts around the injury (like feelings of loss, anger, or frustration when quality of life changes). In some cases, mental health challenges may not be related to a brain injury at all. The good news is that mental health problems are treatable, even if you or someone you care about has experienced a brain injury. It may be helpful to find a service provider who is familiar with both brain injuries and mental health. \n For more information and support, visit the BC Brain Injury Association.

            "Someone I love has been diagnosed with depression. How can I help?",
            "We naturally want to help a loved one who isn\u2019t feeling well. How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say they\u2019re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like depression. Here are some tips: \n You don\u2019t have to understand exactly what someone else is experiencing, you just need to recognize that it\u2019s a difficult experience. You can try something like, \u201cI can see that this experience or these symptoms are really painful for you,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling unwell.\u201d If you have experienced depression yourself, you might say, \u201cI know how you feel.\u201d Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently, and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness, not comparing symptoms. \n You don\u2019t have to be an expert, but learning more about depression can help you understand what\u2019s going on (and maybe dispel some of the unhelpful myths around depression). Our Depression info sheet is a great place to start, and we have a list of resources at Q&A: Where can I learn more about depression? \n Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help\u2014in fact, many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard. It\u2019s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of depression can be very hard for your loved one. You cannot force them to talk about it, but you can invite them to, and create safe and quiet spaces to talk. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively\u2014that is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say. Listen with empathy and without judgement. Even if you don\u2019t understand the problem or see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That\u2019s okay! Respect your loved one\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you what they\u2019re ready to talk about. \n Even when you have the best intentions, unsolicited advice can be unhelpful. You likely can\u2019t fix the problem, and you may not know the whole story. If you\u2019d like to share what worked for you in a similar situation, you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you. \n Different people need different things\u2014don\u2019t assume you know what\u2019s best! Some people need emotional help, like someone they can talk with. Other people may have a good relationship with a counsellor or other professional, but they might need practical help, like help around the house or help sticking to their treatment plan. And others may simply want to be included in some social events. By asking what a person needs, you may also be less tempted to give advice. \n When people experience an episode of depression, they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings. This can take a real toll on others. It\u2019s a good idea to seek support for yourself\u2014there are support groups just for family members and friends. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of family support groups around BC for any mental illness. \n If your loved one isn\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a different option, you can also help them seek different resources or services. You can find general advice in the Ask Us section of HeretoHelp. To find local services, call the BC Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) or email us. \n This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19)\u2014but you can support them as they work towards recovery. In most cases, your loved one\u2019s treatment and recovery plans are their choice\u2014you are there to offer support and encouragement. \n In order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be actively involved. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\u2019t work and will only hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment you disagree with. It\u2019s important to be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Ask Us: An adult in my life seems ill and won\u2019t find help. What can I do? \n If your loved one says that they have thoughts of ending their life, it\u2019s important to take action. Call 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) at any time or message online at www.crisiscentrechat.ca between noon and 1am.

            "Someone I love has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. How can I help?",
            "We naturally want to help a loved one who isn\u2019t feeling well. How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say they\u2019re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like schizophrenia. Here are some tips: \n You don\u2019t have to be an expert in schizophrenia, but learning more can help you understand what\u2019s going on. There are a lot of myths about schizophrenia, so it\u2019s a good idea to find some trustworthy resources. Our Schizophrenia info sheet is a great place to start. You can also find a lot of information from the BC Schizophrenia Society. \n Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help. It\u2019s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of schizophrenia can be very hard for your loved one\u2014and the symptoms of schizophrenia can also make conversations difficult. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively\u2014that is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say. Give them time to finish their thoughts, even if it takes a bit longer than usual. Listen with empathy and without judgement. Even if you don\u2019t understand the problem or you see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That\u2019s okay! Respect your loved one\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you when they\u2019re ready to talk. \n Symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations (sensations that aren\u2019t real, like hearing voices) or delusions (beliefs that can\u2019t be true, like believing that you are being followed by a spy) can take some time to stop even when people are receiving treatment and following their treatment plan. As a group, these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis. Many people have a hard time responding to a loved one\u2019s hallucinations or delusions. It\u2019s best to avoid arguing about these experiences. Remember that delusion are symptoms of schizophrenia\u2014they are not thoughts that you can talk someone out of. Telling someone that their experiences aren\u2019t real or aren\u2019t true doesn\u2019t help when the experiences feel very real to that person! A better approach is to empathize with the feelings that hallucinations or delusions bring up\u2014without confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion. For example, if a loved one is frustrated or upset when they hear voices, it isn\u2019t helpful to say something like, \u201cYou\u2019re okay! It isn\u2019t real. I don\u2019t hear anything.\u201d Instead, you might say, \u201cI can only image how upsetting that voice must be. I can see the voice makes you feel scared.\u201d Know that with good treatment and support, symptoms like hallucinations and delusions become much easier for people to manage and lose importance. \n Ask how you can help. When people experience a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, they may want to plan how they can take action if they start to feel unwell again, especially if they have dependent children. These plans, such as advanced directives or Ulysses Agreements, are made when a person feels well and are meant to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team. Ask your loved one if they have a plan in place so you know what they need if they need help. If you\u2019d like to learn more about planning for care, see the BC Schizophrenia Society. \n If a loved one is experiencing an episode of psychosis or is recovering for an episode of psychosis, they might need extra help. For example, people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions might need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable being around a lot of people or even making eye contact. When people are recovering from an episode of psychosis, they may need a quiet space and a lot of rest. Sometimes people can get back into their usual routines fairly quickly, while other times it may take a lot of time (and effort) to get back into routines. Keep in mind that too much help can be a bit counterproductive. It may well be faster and easier for you to take care of your loved one\u2019s tasks or chores yourself, but rebuilding activity and confidence are a big part of recovery. Encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities, and let them tell you when they need extra help. \n Schizophrenia can be a difficult illness\u2014for everyone. During episodes of psychosis, your loved one may experience frightening sensations that you can\u2019t understand. They may act in ways that you don\u2019t understand. Other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard for people to express emotions or feelings, communicate clearly, or seem interested in others. It\u2019s important to know that these are symptoms of an illness. They are no one\u2019s fault, but they can still be hard to cope with. Consider reaching out to a family and friends support group for your own support. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of groups around BC at www.bcss.org/monthly-meetings-calendar/. \n As a family member, it\u2019s important to take care of yourself. Try to maintain your regular schedule and activities, such as your exercise routine and hobbies. Ask another family member or good friend to provide help with caregiving, especially in the early days of your loved one's illness. If you need help balancing time for self-care with caregiving duties, check out the BC Schizophrenia Society\u2019s Family Respite Program. \n Try to maintain your friendships or the network of people that you have in your life. These will later become important supports as your loved one recovers. Educate them and update them on your loved one's recovery. People are sometimes afraid to ask questions about schizophrenia and this will put them at ease. \n This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19), but you can support them. Schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to make and go to appointments and follow their treatment plan. With your loved one\u2019s permission, you may choose to help by reminding them of appointments, taking them to appointments, or whatever helps in your situation. If your loved one isn\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a new approach, you can encourage them to talk with their care team, like their doctor or mental health team\u2014it can be dangerous to stop or change a treatment without a doctor\u2019s support. \n Treatment can be a difficult area for loved ones. It\u2019s hard to see someone you love in pain. You might be scared of the things your loved one is experiencing. You want to help. But in order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be active in their care. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\u2019t work (or if it does, in the case of an emergency, only for a short time) and can often hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older and not at risk of harm is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment that you disagree with. It helps everyone if you can be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Q&A: An adult in my life seems ill and won\u2019t find help. What can I do?. \n If you think your loved one is at risk of harming themselves or others and they refuse help, it is possible to have them evaluated by a psychiatrist under the Mental Health Act. This process may involve police and other first responders, and it can be a difficult and stressful process for everyone. But it can also be a necessary step if someone is in danger. You can learn more about the Mental Health Act in the info sheet Families Coping with a Crisis and you can find the Guide to the Mental Health Act at www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2005/MentalHealthGuide.pdf. For a more in-depth discussion of the Mental Health Act, see a video with lawyer and health law consultation Gerrit Clements. \n If your loved one says that they have thoughts of ending their life, it\u2019s important to take action.

            "Cannabis is legally allowed to 19+ but there are doctor groups saying it\u2019s potentially harmful to age 25. Any use or certain use? What\u2019s myth and what\u2019s fact? If I\u2019m a parent, what should I tell my young adult?",
            "Using cannabis has the potential for benefits and harms. Young people use cannabis, like other psychoactive drugs, to feel good, to feel better, to do better or to explore. Trying cannabis out of curiosity, as an experiment, or while socializing with friends, is related to moderate use and lower potential for harm. Using cannabis to cope with daily life, deal with unpleasant feelings, or fit in with a social group has higher potential for harm. This is because dealing with these kinds of issues is associated with frequent and heavier use, less thought about potential harms and little consideration of alternatives for coping such as talking with a parent or trusted adult or physical activity with friends. \n Evidence suggests that the younger a person is when they start using cannabis and the more often they use, the greater the potential for harms. The legal age to use cannabis in BC is 19. However, our brains do not finish developing until about age 25. Delaying cannabis use until early adulthood may reduce potential harmful effects on the brain. \n Some young people, especially those with many factors predisposing them to serious and persistent mental health issues, should probably not use cannabis. Cannabis has been associated with an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia in this small group of people. Some people with serious mental health issues have also reported that using cannabis has helped them cope with their illness by helping them feel less anxious or stressed. As in most situations, balancing potential benefits and harms of using cannabis will be key for young people who have serious mental health concerns. \n Mixing drugs, such as cannabis and alcohol, can also increase the possibility of experiencing harms. Intoxication may be more intense and long lasting and the young person may not appreciate how impaired they are. We often suggest, \u201cNot too much, not too often, and only in a safe context\u201d as a simple way to gauge your use of any psychoactive substance. \n As a parent or caring adult, an open respectful relationship with a young person is one of your best resources and ways to prevent harms from substance use. Letting the youth know they can approach you at any time to talk about cannabis, other substances, or anything else of concern to them, says they matter to you and you are ready to listen and engage in dialogue with them. This is a great place to begin addressing anything that might come the young person\u2019s way in life! \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not.

            "What's the difference between mental health and mental illness?",
            "\u2018Mental health\u2019 and \u2018mental illness\u2019 are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing, but they do not. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, \u201cThere is no health without mental health.\u201d In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time. \n When we talk about mental health, we\u2019re talking about our mental well-being: our emotions, our thoughts and feelings, our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties, our social connections, and our understanding of the world around us. \n A mental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples\u2019 lives in different ways. \n Health isn\u2019t like an on/off switch. There are different degrees of health. People move on a continuum ranging from great or good health to so-so health to poor health to illness or disability. For example, some people have good health and have no problems going about their lives. Some people experience serious health problems, and their poor health has a very negative impact on their life. Some people have serious health problems that last for a long time, and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly. Many people fall somewhere in the middle\u2014they\u2019re generally in good health, though the occasional problem may come up. Mental health is the same way. \n Just as someone who feels unwell may not have a serious illness, people may have poor mental health without a mental illness. We all have days where we feel a bit down, or stressed out, or overwhelmed by something that\u2019s happening in our lives. An important part of good mental health is the ability to look at problems or concerns realistically. Good mental health isn\u2019t about feeling happy and confident 100% of time and ignoring any problems. It\u2019s about living and coping well despite problems. \n Just as it\u2019s possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it\u2019s entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That\u2019s because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times (\u2018episodes\u2019) of ill health and times of better or good health. \n With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well\u2014however they define well\u2014and find meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals."

            "Anxiety is a normal reaction to many different kinds of events and situations in our lives. Anxiety is one of our internal warning systems that alerts us to danger or other threats and prepares our bodies to fight back or get out of a dangerous situation. (Scientists call this the \u2018fight, flight, or freeze\u2019 response.) \n A manageable amount of anxiety from time to time can be helpful. For example, it can motivate you to prepare for a test a school or finish a task at work. Even happy events like moving to a new home or celebrating an important milestone can bring up anxiety\u2014all of this is just part of being human. \n Anxiety is a problem when it becomes overwhelming or unmanageable and it comes up unexpectedly. Anxiety disorders are mental illnesses that have a big impact your life. People may avoid going about their daily lives in order to avoid anxiety. They may experience a lot of uncomfortable physical sensations and physical health problems. Many people say that they know their anxiety isn\u2019t based in reality, but they feel \u2018trapped\u2019 by their thought and feelings. Anxiety disorders can be treated. It\u2019s important to seek help if you\u2019re concerned about anxiety in your life. \n Normal anxiety... \n Is related to a specific situation or problem \n Lasts only as long as the situation or problem/p> \n Is proportional to the situation or problem/p> \n Is a realistic response to a realistic problem or situation/p> \n When someone experiences an anxiety disorder... \n Anxiety may come up unexpectedly, for seemingly no reason \n The anxiety response to a situation or problem may be much stronger that they would expect \n They may experience a lot of unrealistic anxiety, such as fear of a situation that likely will never happen \n Anxiety may last for a long time, even when the situation or problem has been resolved \n Anxiety may feel impossible to control or manage \n They may avoid situations or things that they believe to trigger anxiety symptoms \n Here\u2019s an example of normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder. Many people are a bit nervous about flying, which is a totally normal reaction. Yet, if they have to travel for work, they can can get on a plane without any problems. Someone with an anxiety disorder, on the other hand, may not be able to travel to the airport\u2014even if it puts their job in jeopardy. \n *Formerly classified as an anxiety disorder and currently classified as Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders \n **Formerly classified as an anxiety disorder and currently classified as Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders"

            "What's the difference between anxiety and stress?",
            "Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress is related to the same \u2018fight, flight, or freeze\u2019 response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. \n The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we\u2019re finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we\u2019re stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. \n Anxiety, on the other hand, isn\u2019t always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life."

It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time.

Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains.

Schizophrenia does mean \u201csplit mind,\u201d but the name was meant to describe the \u2018split\u2019 from reality that you experience during an episode of psychosis, as well as changes in thoughts, emotions, and other functions. Dissociative identity disorder, on the other hand, does cause a split or fragmented understanding of a person\u2019s sense of themselves. \n Dissociative identity disorder is really more about fragmented identities than many different personalities that develop on their own. Most people see different parts of their being as part of the whole person. For people who experience DID, identity fragments may have very different characteristics, including their own history, identity, and mannerisms. A key part of DID is dissociation\u2014feeling detached to the world around you. People who experience DID may have many unexplainable gaps in their memory, forget information they\u2019re already learned, or have difficulties recalling things they\u2019ve said or done. Unlike portrayals of DID on TV or in movies, DID may not be obvious to others, and it can take a lot of time to come to the diagnosis. \n Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that causes hallucinations (sensations that aren\u2019t real) and delusions (beliefs that can\u2019t possibly be true, in addition to other symptoms like jumbled thoughts, jumbled speech, and difficulties expressing emotions.

Hearing voices is a common hallucination, but hallucinations can be experiences with any sense\u2014hearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch. Delusions are strong beliefs that can\u2019t possibly be true. Common delusions include the belief that someone is following or monitoring you, or the belief that you have extraordinary powers or abilities. Other symptoms of psychosis include difficulties concentrating, completing tasks, or making decisions. Thoughts may feel \u2018jumbled\u2019 or confused.

Psychosis can even affect the way people move or express their emotions. \n Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes psychosis, but schizophrenia also has other symptoms. And it isn\u2019t the only cause of psychosis. In some cases, other mental illnesses cause psychosis, including depression, bipolar disorder, dementia and borderline personality disorder. Psychosis may come up during times of extreme stress, a major lack of sleep, or trauma. People who are using or withdrawing from certain drugs or medications may experience psychosis. Psychosis may also be caused by a brain injury, neurological problem, or other health problem.

On the other hand, \u201cHe is addicted\u201d might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour. When people use the word about psychoactive (mind-altering) substances like alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour. \n The evidence, however, suggests a quite different picture. While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems, substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations. Many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine, for example. Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies. In fact, substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons: to feel good, to feel better, to improve performance, for cultural/spiritual reasons, and to have new experiences. \n Substance use is more complicated than just \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d It\u2019s helpful to think of substance use along a continuum, from beneficial use to harmful use. Along the middle of the continuum, substance use may be both beneficial and harmful. You have an enjoyable night out with friends, but feel a little ill the next day. At the far end of the continuum, some people develop dependence\u2014they need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties, problems at home or at work, health problems, or legal problems. \n In general, substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others\u2014and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations. The reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses a substance to have fun, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person uses a substance to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. Managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us.

No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do. So even though you and your friend may choose to drink, how and why you use alcohol may be different. \n Those of us who drink, seek benefits from alcohol, not difficulties. But sometimes we start using more, and more often, than makes sense. As a general rule, drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others. Many people imagine this refers to people who consume alcohol \u201call day every day.\u201d But even drinking too much on a single occasion can lead to a problem, for instance making a poor decision such as driving while impaired. \n What\u2019s also important to recognize is the potential for negative consequences related to drinking in various contexts (i.e., places, times and activities) and over time (e.g., coping with chronic problems). You can get personalized feedback related to your pattern of drinking as compared to Canada\u2019s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines via the Alcohol Reality Check screening app. This short, simple screen can be used by people of all ages. \n All alcohol use involves some risk. The reasons people use alcohol can influence their risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses alcohol to enhance special celebrations, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person drinks to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. \n By reflecting on your pattern of drinking you can manage your risk for immediate injury or death, your chances for long-term health consequences such as cancer or heart disease, and your risk of developing habitual patterns of drinking that may lead to these harms. \n Whenever you decide to drink alcohol, it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible. The following are some useful guidelines to consider. \n Not too much. Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours. \n Tip: Drink slowly and alternate between non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. \n Not too often. Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time. \n Tip: Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week, avoiding drinking on some days. \n Only in safe contexts. Making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcohol-related harm. \n Tip: If going to a bar, stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options. \n For information on treatment options and resources throughout BC, call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441.

            "Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. \n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship, so they know where to go with questions or problems. \n Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing open, honest conversation about drugs (or any other subject) makes your child know that what they are thinking, feeling and experiencing matters to you. The goal is to get your child talking and sharing their thoughts and feelings. \n When young people are asked thoughtful, open-ended questions exploring what they think, it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour. This process of self-reflection is part of developing critical thinking skills, a part of good decision-making. Critical thinking skills are actually an essential part of reducing the risks related to using drugs. Once young people have considered something carefully, they are a lot less likely to act out of impulse or in response to influence. \n There is no rule about how or where a conversation about alcohol or other drugs should start. Even young children know drugs are a part of our culture. They see people drinking around them and are exposed to drugs on TV and in advertising. This makes it a subject that can be brought up naturally while getting ready for a family celebration where alcohol will be present, or if you are planning to visit a relative who uses tobacco, or while swapping stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day. \n Talking with teens and young adults about drugs as they make choices on the path into adulthood helps them to develop personal standards, minimize risks and critically assess popular beliefs about drug use. This can be particularly important as they transition to the legal age for using alcohol or cannabis and move out of the family home. While young adults have more independence and more legal rights, parents can continue to be an important sounding board on which to try out their thoughts and ideas. \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

            "Cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring component of cannabis. It is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use. CBD is not psychoactive, and does not produce the \u2018high\u2019 of THC (tetrahyrocannabinol), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions. \n All cannabinoids, including CBD, produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. The human body also produces its own cannabinoids. It seems that CBD does not attach directly to receptors. Instead, it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD. \n Research suggests that CBD may provide relief for chronic pain. Sativex is a proprietary medication that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. There is also some evidence suggesting that CBD may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders. The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia. \n After researching the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for treating epilepsy, in 2018, the United States FDA approved CBD (Epidiolex) as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures. Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, though further research is needed before introducing CBD into medical practice. \n There is some initial evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know, and thus slow progression of the illness. Again, more research is needed in this area. \n Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized, scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs, although nothing significant has yet been recorded. CBD has been found to be generally safe. Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common. As with any other treatment, it is important to monitor your use of CBD and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use. \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

            "What is the evidence on vaping?",
            "\"Vaping\" is the term for using a device where liquids, often flavoured, are turned into vapour (hence, vaping) and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element. The liquid is heated to become a mist, inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. Any residual vapour is exhaled. Vaping devices come in several types, shapes, and sizes, referred to as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or e-hookahs. Vaping liquid (e-liquid, e-juice) consists of a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavour, and nicotine or cannabis, though it may not contain anything. In British Columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products. \n The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years, while vaping has increased. E-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests, it may help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco. \n Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. E-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. Long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas. \n Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and 'smoke' in a less harmful way. \n Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed, each other, in making good decisions about if, when, or how much to vape. We offer, \"not too much, not too often, and in a safe context\" as one way to think about using any substance. What this means to you may be a place for talking to start! \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

People who suffer from Type 1 diabetes must be on insulin in order to keep glucose levels within normal limits.Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which either the body is able to produce insulin but is not able to produce enough or the body does not respond to the insulin that is being produced (known as insulin resistance). People with type 2 diabetes must be on a low carbohydrate diet to keep their diabetes from worsening.\nLearn more in Dr. Sarah Hallberg's guide to reversing diabetes."

            "Diabetic ketoacidosis (or DKA) is a serious medical condition that can result from very high levels of ketones in the blood. If it is not recognized and treated right away, then it can lead to a coma or even death. Because it is such a serious condition, a person who develops diabetic ketoacidosis is usually admitted to the hospital for treatment.\nThis condition occurs when the body\u2019s cells are unable to use glucose for energy, and the body begins to break down fat for energy instead. Ketones are produced when the body breaks down fat, and very high levels of ketones can make the blood extremely acidic. The acidity can potentially cause coma and death.\nPeople with type 1 diabetes are at risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis if they do not take their insulin, if they do not eat, or if they become sick for other reasons (such as an infection). It is very unusual for people with type 2 diabetes to develop diabetic ketoacidosis.\nKetoacidosis is different from ketosis. Learn more here: ketosis vs. ketoacidosis."

            "What causes type 2 diabetes?",
            "By Dr. Austin Smith\n\u200dGenes and environment can play a role in causing type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nLet\u2019s first take a step back. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes less responsive to insulin, which is the hormone responsible for shuttling glucose (sugar) from the blood into various tissues throughout the body. Ordinarily, the body\u2019s tissues are made up of cells that contain receptors that bind to insulin. These receptors allow insulin, and the glucose that\u2019s bound to it, to enter the cell. If insulin struggles to bind to these receptors effectively, then glucose ends up remaining in the bloodstream, where cells are unable to use it for fuel. This is known as insulin resistance.\nEventually, the pancreas, which is the organ responsible for producing insulin, can burn out and the amount of insulin it can produce decreases. This is known as relative insulin deficiency.\nBoth insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency can become severe enough to cause type 2 diabetes.\nAnd the causes for both insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency can be traced to one\u2019s genes or environmental influences.\nRarely is it the case that just one gene is responsible for causing type 2 diabetes. More often, multiple genes play a role. These genes are involved in multiple processes throughout the body, including the development of the pancreas and the release of insulin.\nTwo of the most important environmental influences associated with type 2 diabetes are weight gain (although there are also genetic influences on weight) and decreased physical activity. Insulin resistance can be linked to obesity, and improved with weight loss. Exercise, too, can help improve insulin resistance.\nUltimately, if type 2 diabetes develops--be it from insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency, or both--one\u2019s ability to tolerate carbohydrates in the diet drops off significantly. For many, carbohydrates in the diet make up the majority of the body\u2019s supply of glucose. And so if insulin isn\u2019t being produced in normal amounts (relative insulin deficiency) or if insulin can\u2019t bind to its receptors and shuttle glucose into the cells effectively (insulin resistance), then the glucose produced by the breakdown of carbohydrates will end up remaining in the bloodstream, where it can damage various organs.Learn more about reversing diabetes through nutrition.\nCitations:\nJameson, J.

            "Symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus are as varied as they are unpleasant. If you notice any of the symptoms mentioned in this post, it would be advisable to seek medical attention.\nFor example, one might notice an increase in urination. A hallmark feature of type 2 diabetes is an elevated glucose (sugar) level in the blood. When blood glucose levels are high, the kidney struggles to filter the excess glucose out of the urine. The urine thus contains more glucose than it should, and this leads to higher volumes of fluid leaving the body through the urine. This is often accompanied by an increase in thirst. Sometimes the fluid losses from the urine are so great that it can lead to weight loss. To be clear, developing type 2 diabetes as a way to lose weight is dangerous, ill-advised, and should never be pursued.\nAdditionally, type 2 diabetes makes it difficult for the body\u2019s organs to receive dietary fuel in the form of glucose. And when the body\u2019s organs aren\u2019t getting the energy they need to perform as they should, this can lead to fatigue and hunger.\nType 2 diabetes also makes it harder for the body to heal. This can lead to more frequent infections and slow-healing wounds.\nElevated blood glucose levels from type 2 diabetes can lead to blurry vision. Vision can improve as blood glucose levels decrease.\nAs if all the above weren\u2019t enough, sometimes type 2 diabetes can lead to very severe dehydration and a significant impairment of one\u2019s ability to think and speak clearly. And yes, while any of the above symptoms warrant seeking medical attention, these particularly worrisome symptoms warrant seeking medical attention immediately.\nLearn more about reversing diabetes through nutrition."

However, there are some additional symptoms in women that may signal possible type 2 diabetes. These include frequent vaginal yeast infections or urinary tract infections. High blood glucose levels make infections more common and difficult to treat. While there are obviously many possible cause for these infections, patients experiencing recurrent or severe infections should consider evaluation for diabetes.\nAnother frequent issue seen in women with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). This syndrome is thought to be connected to insulin resistance, a key component of diabetes, and common symptoms of PCOS include irregular menstrual periods, acne, pelvic pain, and infertility.\nIn addition, it is important to note that women with a history of gestational diabetes during pregnancy have an increased chance of developing type 2 diabetes in the future.

            "How can you prevent type 2 diabetes?",
            "One of the most important first steps one can take to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is to reach out to a primary care provider.\nBy doing so, it will be possible to undergo basic screening tests for type 2 diabetes.\nFor example, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)\u2014which issues guidance on a variety of issues based on medical experts\u2019 review of all relevant scientific studies\u2014recommends screening for abnormal blood sugars in adults aged 40 to 70 years who are considered overweight (that is, having a Body Mass Index of 25-29.9) or obese (that is, having a Body Mass Index of 30 or above).\nThis isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule, however. And there are other similar organizations that issue guidelines for screening that differ slightly. The bottom line is that even if one doesn\u2019t meet the above-mentioned criteria from USPSTF, a simple discussion with one\u2019s primary care provider can lead to a personalized approach to screening that\u2019s sensible.\nScreening tests for type 2 diabetes will reveal one of three possible outcomes: 1) normal blood sugar, 2) somewhat elevated blood sugar (prediabetes), or 3) significantly elevated blood sugar (type 2 diabetes).\nIn the event that screening doesn\u2019t reveal type 2 diabetes, then there are options available that can help prevent or at least delay the onset of diabetes.\nFor all patients, smoking cessation, physical activity, and dietary changes are recommended to help bring blood sugar levels closer to the normal range.\nEvidence from scientific studies has shown that 150 minutes a week of either moderate aerobic exercise or weight training can help prevent type 2 diabetes.\n\u200dDiet and Preventing Type 2 Diabetes\n\u200dA growing body of evidence shows that a well-formulated ketogenic diet can improve and even reverse T2DM. Please see our related post on the best diet for type 2 diabetes.\nOngoing scientific work has shown that Virta's treatment, which includes a well-formulated ketogenic diet, helps significantly lower blood sugars in those with T2DM. In Virta's clinical trial, the Virta treatment has been found to reverse T2DM in 60% of patients at one year. At present, Virta cares for patients with T2DM and those with prediabetes. Patients living with prediabetes are excited by the prospect that Virta will help prevent T2DM.\nThere is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet can help prevent type 2 diabetes. Although there\u2019s no single, universally agreed-upon definition of a Mediterranean diet, it\u2019s typically comprised mostly of nuts, whole grains, fruits, olive oil, vegetables, beans, and seeds.\nOne medication, metformin, has been shown in multiple studies to be effective at preventing the onset of T2DM. Metformin is both inexpensive and without long-term safety concerns.\nThe most prudent way to get on track toward preventing T2DM is to have a discussion with one\u2019s primary care provider about the above-mentioned options to help craft an individualized approach that will suit your values and needs best."

Studies have also shown an association between eating foods that contain trans fats and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. But these studies, by their design, were not intended to evaluate whether these foods could be identified as having caused type 2 diabetes. Another type of study would be better suited to test whether certain foods can be identified as causes of type 2 diabetes.

But other nerves throughout the body can be damaged as well.\nSymptoms can vary considerably, and depend on the particular nerves that have been damaged. One might experience tingling, numbness, muscle weakness, or burning pains. Or one might experience a high heart rate even at rest, or even sudden decreases in blood pressure when rising to a standing position. Severity can span quite a range, from barely noticeable to significantly painful.\nAll people living with type 2 diabetes are at risk for developing diabetic neuropathy. There are certain factors that make diabetic neuropathy more likely, however. The longer one has T2DM, the higher the risk. The higher one\u2019s blood sugars, the higher the risk. Cigarette smokers, too, carry a higher risk of developing diabetic neuropathy.\nDiabetic neuropathy can lead to the development of a number of other health problems. For example, numbness in the feet can make it more difficult to notice a small wound that might continue to fester unnoticed until it\u2019s become infected. Such an infection could spread to other parts of the body. This could lead to joint damage or even the amputation of a limb. Diabetic neuropathy could even make it more difficult to experience symptoms like, for example, sweating, which would ordinarily alert someone with T2DM of a low blood sugar.\nKeeping one\u2019s blood sugars in a good range, as determined by your health care provider, can help prevent symptoms and even improve symptoms if they\u2019ve already developed. Achieving and maintaining a healthy blood pressure, as determined by your health care provider, can also help reduce the risk of developing diabetic neuropathy. Quitting smoking also helps. As can aerobic exercise.\nIn the event the pain becomes too severe, prescription medications can be tried, although they can help only to reduce the pain, not eliminate it.\nLearn more about reversing diabetes through nutrition.\nCitations:\nJameson, J.

But these new blood vessels don\u2019t work very well, either, as they can be prone to leaking. The growth of these new blood vessels can lead to the retina becoming detached, which can lead to other vision problems, including vision loss. Moreover, the newly-formed blood vessels can increase the risk of developing glaucoma.\nDiabetic retinopathy can cause a range of symptoms, whether it\u2019s blurry vision, an inability to distinguish between colors, or vision loss. But symptoms generally don\u2019t emerge very quickly, which is why patients living with T2DM are advised to see an eye physician (ophthalmologist) on a regular basis for eye exams that can help detect the presence of diabetic retinopathy.\nThe longer one has type 2 diabetes, the greater the risk becomes of developing diabetic retinopathy. And higher blood sugars tend to be associated with a higher risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.Not everyone with type 2 diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy. But for folks living with type 2 diabetes, keeping blood sugars under good control can help prevent severe vision loss, and even slow progression of retinopathy. Quitting smoking can also help lower one\u2019s risk, as can keeping one\u2019s blood pressure in a healthy range. In the event that severe diabetic retinopathy develops, a number of treatments can help. The optimal treatment option is chosen based on the specific features of one\u2019s retina.Learn more about reversing diabetes through nutrition.\nCitations:\nCDC Features - Watch Out for Diabetic Retinopathy.

            "There are many complications (problems) that can happen to the feet when a person is diagnosed with diabetes. These include problems with the nerves, problems with the blood vessels, and problems with healing.\nDiabetic neuropathy is nerve damage that is caused by diabetes, and it can cause numbness, tingling, and inability to feel heat, cold, or pain in the feet. It can lead to changes in the shape of the foot and toes (also called Charcot foot). Because of the nerve damage, people who have diabetic neuropathy can injure their feet and not realize it. These injuries can cause several different types of wounds, such as ulcers, cuts, blisters, and scrapes. Once these wounds occur, they can be slow to heal and can easily develop infections.\nCirculation (or blood vessel) problems that are also caused by diabetes can lead to slow wound healing and infections. Infections become difficult to treat because antibiotics rely on the blood vessels to carry the antibiotic through the bloodstream to the feet and toes (where the infection is happening). It can sometimes take several weeks or months for these wounds to heal for these reasons.\nOther common diabetic foot problems include fungal infections and development of corns and calluses on the feet and toes. Some people also notice loss of hair on their toes, feet, and the lower part of their legs."

            "By Dr. Kelley Struble\n\u200dChecking your feet on a daily basis and avoiding injuries to your feet are the best way to prevent diabetic foot problems. Keeping good control of your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels also helps slow the progression of nerve and blood vessel damage that causes diabetic foot problems. It is also best to have your feet checked by your physician or podiatrist (foot doctor) at least once a year.\nIf you notice redness, swelling, ulcers, blisters, corns, or calluses on your feet, then notify your physician right away. This is the best way to make sure any small wounds or infections are quickly treated before they become more serious. In many cases, antibiotics are given for treatment of infections. If a wound develops, then dressings and medications are applied to the foot in order to help the wounds heal.\nA person with diabetic foot problems who develops a wound that either does not heal or develops a serious infection may sometimes need to have a surgery (amputation) performed in order to treat the problem. The best way to avoid this is to make sure you are seen by your physician as soon as you notice a problem with your foot.\nLearn more in Reversing Diabetes 101 by Dr. Sarah Hallberg."

            "By Dr. Kelley Struble\u200d\nGestational diabetes is high blood glucose (sugar) in a pregnant woman who has never had diabetes before, and it only occurs when a woman is pregnant.\nThe cause of this condition is not completely understood. It is thought that the hormones that are normally present during pregnancy block the effects of insulin in the mother\u2019s body. This leads to a buildup of high blood glucose levels. This condition goes away after the baby is delivered and the pregnancy hormones return to normal levels.\nGestational diabetes that is not treated during the pregnancy can cause certain problems for the baby. One of these problems is a condition called macrosomia, which means the baby is born overweight. Babies with macrosomia can suffer from shoulder damage during birth, and they can have problems with their blood sugar and ability to breathe at birth as well. Protecting the baby from these problems is the main reason why diagnosing and treating gestational diabetes during the pregnancy is so important.\nMothers who have gestational diabetes are at risk for developing high blood pressure during the pregnancy. This leads to a higher likelihood of having to undergo a C-section when the baby is born. In addition, the mother is at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on after the baby is born."

            "By Dr. Kelley Struble\u200d\nThese symptoms can include feeling thirsty, feeling hungry, having a dry mouth, urinating often, and being tired. Because these symptoms typically occur with pregnancy anyways, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes is usually made by lab work that is routinely performed during pregnancy.\nGestational diabetes usually develops during the sixth month of pregnancy or later, and this is usually when the mother will be tested for this condition. Mothers who are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes may be tested sooner than that. Typically, a glucose screening test is performed, which consists of drinking a liquid that contains glucose (sugar), and blood is drawn one hour afterwards to assess the blood glucose level. Depending on the results of the blood glucose level, a glucose tolerance test may be performed.\nA glucose tolerance test can consist of several steps. First, the mother will be asked to fast (not eat) the night before the test. Then, blood is drawn the next morning while the mother is still fasting. The mother will then drink the liquid glucose again and have labs drawn one hour, two hours, and three hours afterward. The lab measures the blood glucose levels at each of these intervals. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is confirmed based on the results of these tests."

Also, women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy are more likely to develop it if they become pregnant again."

            "When our body is unable to properly use and store glucose, the disease is referred as diabetes (Diabetes Mellitus). Glucose comes back in the bloodstream and hence the person\u2019s blood glucose (commonly called as blood sugar) levels shoot up high.\n\nType 1 \u2013 This used to be called \u2013 juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes as it is commonly seen in children & young adults. However, it can occur at any age.\nInsulin is a hormone that helps our body to use glucose from the food that we eat and convert it to energy units. In type 1 diabetes, the body is unable to produce insulin. Hence, the person must take insulin injections every day.\nType 2 \u2013 This used to be called \u2013 adult-onset or non insulin-dependent diabetes as it usually occurs in people above 40 years, overweight and have a family history of diabetes. However, due to sedentary lifestyle, it is seen more in younger age group. Type 2 diabetes can often get unnoticed or undiagnosed for years.\nIn this condition, our body doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin and/or is unable to use insulin properly (also called as insulin resistance). See the illustration below:\n\nGestational diabetes \u2013 This form of diabetes occurs only during pregnancy & often strikes between 24th & 28th week of pregnacny. It poses serious risk for both the mother and child. Although, the condition typically ends after delivery, these women often have about 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the next 7-10 years. Timely diagnosis is extremely important to reduce the incidence of this condition. With proper diet and nutrition and careful management of diabetes, women can and do have successful pregancies and also deliver healthy babies."

            "Insulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the blood stream and enter the cells. People with type I diabetes cannot make their own insulin in the body and must take insulin injections to meet the regular requirement. They can survive without insulin injections, but many may take insulin injections to control blood glucose levels more effectively. Insulin is taken as an injection. Patients who need insulin is taught to give his/her injections themselves.In type II diabetes, the patient's body makes insulin, but is not able to use it effectively. They use medicines to control blood sugar in the form of pills, usually once or twice a day. These medicines work by preventing the body from sending sugar into the bloodstream when the naturally produced insulin is not working properly, releasing more Insulin into the bloodstream, and helping the body's own insulin move glucose from the bloodstream into the cells. Some people need insulin in addition to oral medicines. Some people no longer need medicines if they lose weight because their own insulin output is sufficient after reducing weight, fat, and sugar.Insulin is taken as an injection. It is not available in tablet form."
