what does it mean to have a mental illness,"Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a persons thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life.Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital.It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a persons character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brains biology.Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.",mental_health
who does mental illness affect,"It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background.Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children.Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition.Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their childs mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs).",mental_health

what should i know before starting a new medication,"The best source of information regarding medications is the physician prescribing them. He or she should be able to answer questions such as:1. What is the medication supposed to do? 2. When should it begin to take effect, and how will I know when it is effective? 3. How is the medication taken and for how long? What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication? 4. What are the side effects and what should be done if they occur? 5. What do I do if a dose is missed? 6. Is there any written information available about this medication? 7. Are there other medications that might be appropriate? 8. If so, why do you prefer the one you have chosen? 9. How do you monitor medications and what symptoms indicate that they should be raised, lowered, or changed? 10.

if i feel better after taking medication does this mean i am cured and can stop taking it,"It is not uncommon for people to stop taking their medication when they feel their symptoms are under control. Others may choose to stop taking their medication because of its side effects, without realizing that most side effects can be effectively managed. While it may seem reasonable to stop taking the medication, the problem is that most often, the symptoms will return. If you or your child is taking medication, it is very important that you work together with your doctor before making decisions about any changes in your treatment. Another problem with stopping medication, particularly for stopping it abruptly, is that you may develop withdrawal symptoms that can be very unpleasant. If you and your doctor feel a trial off your medicine is a good idea, it is necessary to slowly decrease the dosage of medications so that these symptoms dont occur. It is important that your doctor and pharmacist work together to make sure your medications are working safely and effectively. You should talk with them about how you are doing and if there are side effects that make you unwilling to continue treatment. They will work with you to develop strategies for minimizing these side effects, or will create a plan for switching to a different treatment that will be a better fit.",mental_health

why do i need to keep informed,"It may be tempting to try to block out the world altogether to avoid bad news, but it's important to keep yourself informed. We all have to step up during a pandemic because we all have a part to play in reducing the spread of the virus. It's important that you know what must be done and how you should do it. This is important for the health of your neighbours and your own mental health, and taking action can help counter difficult feelings like hopelessness and despair.One study from people in China found that people who had reliable up-to-date information about the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness and accurate instructions on how they should act (such as instructions around hand-washing and wearing a mask) felt more resilient and felt better able to handle the virus. People who received good, accurate information reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This research is available for free at www.mdpi.com 1660-4601 17 5 1729.Of course, it's okay to set limits. Staying informed does not mean that you have to follow the news all day. Check in a few times a day, sticking to trusted sources and media outlets. While social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, social media can also amplify bad advice, vague or untrue stories, and other unhelpful information. Be sure to use good critical thinking skills.",mental_health
how can i tell if health information is good or bad,"Anyone can post anything online. It's up to the readers to think critically about information to decide if it seems helpful, truthful, or safe. Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test.It's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source.Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information.Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more.Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed.Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals?Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like ""Skyrocketing rates of infection"" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like ""We have 50 new cases in BC"" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered.Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service?Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community.Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information.Visit www.mediasmarts.ca to learn more about digital and media literacyVisit www.healthnewsreview.org to learn more about thinking critically around health claims (this resource is no longer updated daily, but all toolkits and lessons are still available)This page is adapted from the Evaluating Mental Health and Substance Use Information info sheet.",mental_health
why do i need a plan,"There are a lot of things you can't control. You can't control what happens next, how governments respond, or how your neighbours react to the pandemic. What you can do is make a plan and decide how you'll manage the things you do control, like your ability to stay safe, follow public health measures, stay connected with loved ones, and take care of your mental and physical health.Events like a pandemic change a lot over time, and that uncertainty can add to fear and stress. The truth is that we don't know what will happen nextbut that doesn't mean we're all helpless. You can do a lot. You can:Map out a daily schedule, including times you can connect with loved ones online or by phonePlan out daily tasks and goalsGive yourself a schedule to look up current informationMake sure you have 14 days of healthy food and household supplies at homeKeep medications on hand and talk to your doctor for advice if you're at increased riskEducate yourself on public health measures and figure out how you'll follow those instructionsFigure out how you'll manage increased childcare demands, working for home, or other changes to your usual routineDetermine if you'll need financial supports like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or BC Temporary Rent Supplement if your job is affected by COVID-19. If you anticipate a need, you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of timeFigure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless, like calming activities, the number for a local support or crisis line, a video chat with a loved one, or a way to connect with your mental health care providerLook for local support organizations, neighbourhood groups, or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your communitySome planning will be straightforward, but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action. This is a great time to practice problem-solving skills. Problem-solving is a method that helps you break down a complicated situation into manageable pieces, look for realistic and unbiased information, brainstorm possible solutions, and test the solutions that you think might work well. Problem-solving is a helpful skill no matter what else is going on in the world, and it's an empowering, methodical approach when you might otherwise feel overwhelmed or lost.Check out the following resources for more information about problem-solving:Wellness Module 4: Problem-Solving: www.heretohelp.bc.ca wellness-module wellness-module-4-problem-solvingProblem-solving worksheet from Anxiety Canada: www.anxietycanada.com sites default files ProblemSolving.pdfEffective Problem-Solving in The Antidepressant Skills Workbook: psychhealthandsafety.org asw",mental_health
how can i maintain social connections what if i feel lonely,"A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together.While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear.Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week.Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help.The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution.Everyone feels lonely at timesmaybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now.Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks.Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support.Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone.

how can i take care of my physical health,"Taking care of your physical health is also good for your mental health. It's more important than ever to keep yourself healthy.Try to eat as well as you can. It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home, but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries, dont ignore fresh fruit and vegetableswe still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores, this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time.If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in self-isolation, reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe, no-contact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries, or look for local COVID-19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus.Exercise is an important part of mental health and well-being, stress management, and health sleep. However, it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed.If it's safe for you to do so, spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others, but there is no reason to avoid walks, runs, or other safe outdoor activities. (Note that some municipalities, BC Parks, and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds, so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closuresthey're just keeping everyone safe.)If you prefer to exercise indoors, you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga, follow a barre class, work on your cardio, pick up a new dumbbell routine, and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for no-equipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment.Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood, your outlook, and your patience. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping, be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits. For more, check out Wellness Module 6: Getting a Good Night's Sleep at www.heretohelp.bc.ca wellness-module wellness-module-6-getting-a-good-nights-sleep.If you have other health problems like a chronic illness, check in with your doctor or health care team to see if you need to take any additional measures or precautions. Remember to plan ahead and do what you can to keep prescription or over-the-counter medications, medical supplies, supplements, or other health needs on hand.",mental_health
how can i use distraction to manage difficult thoughts or feelings,"Distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated.If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project.If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more.When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or familywhoever takes the most language classes wins!Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment. This can be a great way to make new connections in your area, and helping others is good for your own mental health. Just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancingyour own health is important.",mental_health
how can i reframe the situation and find more balanced perspectives,"How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours.When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it's hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what's going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.)People often overestimate the negative partstheir own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itselfand underestimate positive partstheir own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities.How does the thought ""We're never going to make it through this!"" make you feel? It likely doesn't feel goodand it isn't even true.Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well.Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation?Here are a few example:""I'm so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!""""I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it's rescheduled, I'll enjoy it more because I won't have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.""""I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.""""I'm doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It's worth it because it keeps people healthy.""""I'm having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.""""I'll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule.

how can i challenge thinking traps,"What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspectsthis is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term.These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well.Here are some common thinking traps:Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like ""always"" or ""never.""I was really looking forward to that concert, and now its cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things!Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure.I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure!Saying only negative things about yourself or other people.I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk!Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence.I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick.Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive.I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible.Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation.I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better.Telling yourself how you ""should"" or ""must"" act.I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying!Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca.Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way.This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind.Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens:What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on.What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself?What are your emotions? How do you feel?What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope?Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation.The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that:Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, ""I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!"" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, ""Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?"" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee.Ask yourself, ""Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?"" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism.Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, ""Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem."" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids.Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you.Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example:I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do.I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this!Labeling'Should' statementsExamine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this.It's okay to feel upset right nowthere's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together.Try the Healthy Thinking Worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.caCheck out Anxiety Canada's articles Helpful Thinking and Thinking TrapsThis page is adapted from Wellness Module 8: Healthy Thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca wellness-module wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking.",mental_health
how can i manage grief,"While a lot of people think of grief in terms of losing a person or pet, grief can come up whenever you lose something important. This includes:Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rentLosing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closuresLosing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolationLosing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normalLosing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable futureLosing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddingsGrief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again.Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey.Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art.Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait.Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other.Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities.Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass.Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings, it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellormany now offer online or phone appointments.

what is a referral,"A referral means someone recommends you to another service. In health care, it usually means a request from your doctor to see a specialist like a psychiatrist.To access any specialist in BC, you first need a referral. You may need to meet certain criteria, like a specific diagnosis or specific symptoms, to access some specialists. Your doctor can tell you what to expect.Once your doctor has made the referral, the specialists office will contact you with an appointment time. Make sure your doctors office has your current contact information so the specialist can reach you.The process is the same whether you see the same family doctor or visit a walk-in clinic.Not all mental health programs in BC require a doctors referral. This is good news for people who are looking for help! A ""self-referral"" means that you ask to see someone, and then you will be evaluated to see if you meet the criteria to receive services. Contact your local health authority to learn more about programs in your area:",mental_health
whats the difference between a psychiatrist and a registered psychologist,"A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with extra training in mental health who can choose to prescribe medications. Some use psychotherapy (talk therapies) approaches like cognitive-behavioural therapy to treat mental health problems. Many psychiatrists work at hospitals, clinics, or health centres, and some have a private office. As they are specialist doctors, you will almost always need another doctors referral to see a psychiatrist, and fees are covered by MSP. If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard, you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist.A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments, but they dont prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to access registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools. You may need a doctors referral to access the program, and costs are usually covered by MSP. However, most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this, you can contact the psychologist yourselfyou do not need a referral. Costs are not covered by MSP, but they may be covered by employee health plans. A registered psychologists fees charged by hour vary, and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes.Youve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated. The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear. When it comes to your treatment and care, the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on fine-tuning medications? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach? Does the professionals philosophy of care make sense to you? Do you like the professional youre talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences? Ultimately, your relationship with the professional is what matters. Instead of focusing on designation, look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations.Talk to your family doctor and ask for their recommendationsAsk local mental health organizations for help. You can find local branches through the provincial organizations behind HeretoHelpAsk a community health centre, outpatient psychiatry program, or mental health team for suggestionsFor a list of psychiatrists near you, search under Specialist in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbias Find a Physician Tool but remember that you will first need a referral from a doctor (like your family doctor)For a list of psychologists near you, search in the British Columbia Psychological Associations Find a Registered Psychologist tool and you can also learn more about finding a psychologist from the College of Psychologists of British Columbia",mental_health
whats the difference between psychotherapy and counselling,"Psychotherapy and counselling have a lot in common and usually mean the same thing. Both are used to describe professionals who use talk-based approaches to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem. Many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy, including registered psychologists, registered clinical counsellors, psychiatrists, other therapists and counsellors, family doctors, psychiatric nurses, and faith leaders.Its useful to talk to someone about any problema lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better. A professional therapist or counsellor can offer more: they have training, experience, and emotional distance (since they dont know you). They use different theories to listen to you, support you, and approach different problems or patterns. For example, a psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions, well-being, and future thoughts and behaviours. A therapist could help you learn and practice these skills.There are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses. A few examples include cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, solutions-focused brief psychotherapy, narrative therapy, and emotion-focused therapy.In general, some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same, no matter which approach you choose: the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions, the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapists understanding of the problem, and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist. In fact, one research review found that 50% of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor (called non-directive supportive therapy) was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist.1 Psychotherapy can and does work, but the professional you choose, and their match with your values, is also very important.When youre looking for a professional, its always a good idea to ask if they are a member of a professional organization (like those listed in the next section).",mental_health
whats the difference between cbt and dbt,"CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy) and DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) are two forms of psychotherapy or talk therapy. In both, you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you experience and learn skills to help you manage challenges on your own.Cognitive-behavioural therapy or CBT teaches you how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours influence each other. For example, if you believe that people dont like you (thought), you might avoid social situations (behaviour) and feel lonely (feeling). However, CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage: a positive change in one factor (changing a thought or behaviour) can lead to positive changes in all factors. CBT is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and substance use problems.CBT is structured, short-term, goal-oriented and focused on the present. It starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you. Next, youll learn and practice skills and strategies like problem-solving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Youll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future.Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT is based on CBT, with greater focus on emotional and social aspects. DBT was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours. DBT is an evidence-based approach to help people regulate emotions. It started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder, and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns, particularly self-harm.Key differences between CBT and DBT are validation and relationships. DBT teaches you that your experiences are real, and it teaches you how to accept who you are, regardless of challenges or difficult experiences. Relationships are also very important in DBTincluding the relationships between you and your DBT practitioner. You may have frequent check-ins to talk about any successes or problems. Treatment may include a mix of one-on-one sessions and group sessions. In addition to CBT skills, youll learn skills around managing your emotions, building relationships with others, coping well with problems or distress, acceptance, and mindfulness.As with many talk therapies, it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills. But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist, they often find that their new skills and strategies become second naturethey are tools that last a lifetime.",mental_health
whats the difference between antidepressants,"There are many different types of antidepressant medications, and they each work in different ways. Antidepressants are divided into classes based on what they do and which chemical messengers in the brain (called neurotransmitters) they are thought to influence. Each class may contain several different medications, which each have slightly different ways of working. Below, youll find common classes and examples of common medications. The first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name.SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex), and sertraline (Zoloft)SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta)NDRIs or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors: bupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban)NaSSAs or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants: mirtazapine (Remeron), which can also be classed as a TeCa or tetracyclic antidepressantSARIs or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors: trazodone (Desyrel)There are other classes of antidepressants (such as MAOIs or triclycics) that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions. They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants dont work. Other medications such as lithium, thyroid medication, or antipsychotics may also be prescribed, often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depressionthey may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders.Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants, keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process, especially when you feel unwell, but its important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and its difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first. Everyone responds to them differently. Its very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concernsor even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works.",mental_health
i received a diagnosis but i dont think its right what can i do,"If possible, bring up your concerns with the professional who provided the diagnosis. That way, the professional can answer your questions and you can better understand their decision.If that doesnt resolve the situation or a follow-up appointment isnt possible, you can ask for a second opinion. A second opinion is an assessment from a different professional. This can give you better understanding of whats going on and what to do about it. Second opinions are common when it comes to major health decisionsyou wont hurt anyones feelings and your doctor will try to accommodate reasonable requests for a second opinion. Talk to your family doctor (or go to a walk-in clinic) to discuss your options and get a referral to a different program or health professional, if needed.For more how to get a second opinion, see HealthLinkBCs factsheet at www.healthlinkbc.ca.For general tips on managing a diagnosis of a mental illness and working well with health care professionals, see HeretoHelps Managing a Mental Illness series.",mental_health
i was prescribed an antidepressant or other psychiatric medication but i dont think its working what can i do,"If youre concerned about your medications, its important to talk with the doctor or psychiatrist who prescribed your medications. While it can take a few weeks to really see improvements with many antidepressants, its still a good idea to talk to your doctor about what to expect.Talk to the doctor that prescribed your medication if you experience symptoms or side effects that are distressing you. If you want to talk to a trusted professional about the most common side effects, call your pharmacist. You can reach a pharmacist by phone after-hours by calling 811.Its also best not to stop taking the medication or changing the dose on your own without first talking to a health care provider. While it might be tempting to stop taking your medication when you start feel better, its important to follow your doctors instructions.In some cases, people can have an allergic reaction to a medication. Some reactions are not serious, like a rash. In these cases, you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help after-hours. If you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing, dizziness, or confusion, call 911 right away.When you start a new medication, your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects, signs of an allergic reaction, how long it might take to work, and other information. Its good information to keep on hand, but it isnt always easy to read. When you pick up your medication, you can ask the pharmacist to go over the information with you so you understand what you should look for.If a particular antidepressant or psychiatric medication just isnt working for you, there are many different options! Unfortunately, finding the right medication can take some trial and error. Different people can have very different experiences with the same medication, and often you need to try something to see if it works (or doesnt work) for you. This can be a frustrating process, especially when you want to start feeling better, but its important to keep trying and work with your doctor so you understand your options. Many people feel intimidated talking to health professionals, but its important to share information so you both understand whats going on and can make good, informed decisions about your health care. Some people also feel embarrassed talking about symptoms or side effects like changes in sex drive or digestion, but its important information for your doctor (and they know that changes in sex drive or digestion are common concerns).

an adult in my life seems ill and wont find help what can i do,"Its difficult when an adult child, sibling, parent, friend, co-worker, or other important person is struggling or behaving in ways that are causing harm. This can be a tricky situationyou want to help, but most adults are responsible for their own care.There are two important points to think about. First, diagnosing a health condition, especially when symptom-checking is so easy online, can be dangerous. Diagnosis is still always best left to professionals who can look at the whole picture. Remember, too, that the person you care about may have a very different idea of whats causing their difficulties and what the negative impacts are on their life. Second, except in rare cases, the person being treated needs to be an active player in their own recovery to continue with their treatment, just as they would for any other health problem. If the vast majority of cases, you cannot do this work entirely for themand trying to do so may damage your relationship.Be honest about your concerns, the impacts you are seeing that worry you, listen to their point of view and work together to find a solution that works for everyone, even if it means a compromise. You may want to offer to go with them to an appointment, encourage them to do an online screening self-test, or involve someone else close to them who may be similarly concerned and may have more influence in encouraging them to notice changes and seek help. Because you may be feeling frustrated and helpless, its important to get care and support for yourself during this time, especially if youre very close to the person youre worried about.In serious situations, the BC Mental Health Act allows someone to be held for a period of time for psychiatric assessment without their consent if they are at risk of harming themselves or others. While its necessary in some situations to get someone the care they need, it can be traumatic for everyone involved.

someone i love has been diagnosed with depression how can i help,"We naturally want to help a loved one who isnt feeling well. How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say theyre not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like depression. Here are some tips:You dont have to understand exactly what someone else is experiencing, you just need to recognize that its a difficult experience. You can try something like, I can see that this experience or these symptoms are really painful for you, or, Im sorry to hear that youre feeling unwell. If you have experienced depression yourself, you might say, I know how you feel. Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently, and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness, not comparing symptoms.You dont have to be an expert, but learning more about depression can help you understand whats going on (and maybe dispel some of the unhelpful myths around depression). Our Depression info sheet is a great place to start, and we have a list of resources at Q& Where can I learn more about depression?Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really helpin fact, many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard.

There are a lot of myths about schizophrenia, so its a good idea to find some trustworthy resources. Our Schizophrenia info sheet is a great place to start. You can also find a lot of information from the BC Schizophrenia Society.Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help. Its important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of schizophrenia can be very hard for your loved oneand the symptoms of schizophrenia can also make conversations difficult. If a loved one opens up to you, listen activelythat is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say.

Even if you dont understand the problem or you see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. Thats okay! Respect your loved ones boundaries and let them tell you when theyre ready to talk.Symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations (sensations that arent real, like hearing voices) or delusions (beliefs that cant be true, like believing that you are being followed by a spy) can take some time to stop even when people are receiving treatment and following their treatment plan. As a group, these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis. Many people have a hard time responding to a loved ones hallucinations or delusions. Its best to avoid arguing about these experiences. Remember that delusion are symptoms of schizophreniathey are not thoughts that you can talk someone out of. Telling someone that their experiences arent real or arent true doesnt help when the experiences feel very real to that person! A better approach is to empathize with the feelings that hallucinations or delusions bring upwithout confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion. For example, if a loved one is frustrated or upset when they hear voices, it isnt helpful to say something like, Youre okay! It isnt real. I dont hear anything. Instead, you might say, I can only image how upsetting that voice must be. I can see the voice makes you feel scared. Know that with good treatment and support, symptoms like hallucinations and delusions become much easier for people to manage and lose importance.Ask how you can help. When people experience a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, they may want to plan how they can take action if they start to feel unwell again, especially if they have dependent children. These plans, such as advanced directives or Ulysses Agreements, are made when a person feels well and are meant to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team. Ask your loved one if they have a plan in place so you know what they need if they need help. If youd like to learn more about planning for care, see the BC Schizophrenia Society.If a loved one is experiencing an episode of psychosis or is recovering for an episode of psychosis, they might need extra help. For example, people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions might need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable being around a lot of people or even making eye contact. When people are recovering from an episode of psychosis, they may need a quiet space and a lot of rest. Sometimes people can get back into their usual routines fairly quickly, while other times it may take a lot of time (and effort) to get back into routines. Keep in mind that too much help can be a bit counterproductive. It may well be faster and easier for you to take care of your loved ones tasks or chores yourself, but rebuilding activity and confidence are a big part of recovery. Encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities, and let them tell you when they need extra help.Schizophrenia can be a difficult illnessfor everyone. During episodes of psychosis, your loved one may experience frightening sensations that you cant understand. They may act in ways that you dont understand. Other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard for people to express emotions or feelings, communicate clearly, or seem interested in others. Its important to know that these are symptoms of an illness. They are no ones fault, but they can still be hard to cope with. Consider reaching out to a family and friends support group for your own support. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of groups around BC at www.bcss.org monthly-meetings-calendar .As a family member, its important to take care of yourself. Try to maintain your regular schedule and activities, such as your exercise routine and hobbies. Ask another family member or good friend to provide help with caregiving, especially in the early days of your loved one's illness. If you need help balancing time for self-care with caregiving duties, check out the BC Schizophrenia Societys Family Respite Program.Try to maintain your friendships or the network of people that you have in your life. These will later become important supports as your loved one recovers. Educate them and update them on your loved one's recovery. People are sometimes afraid to ask questions about schizophrenia and this will put them at ease.This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved ones treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19), but you can support them. Schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to make and go to appointments and follow their treatment plan. With your loved ones permission, you may choose to help by reminding them of appointments, taking them to appointments, or whatever helps in your situation. If your loved one isnt happy with their treatment or would like to try a new approach, you can encourage them to talk with their care team, like their doctor or mental health teamit can be dangerous to stop or change a treatment without a doctors support.Treatment can be a difficult area for loved ones. Its hard to see someone you love in pain. You might be scared of the things your loved one is experiencing. You want to help. But in order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be active in their care. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesnt work (or if it does, in the case of an emergency, only for a short time) and can often hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older and not at risk of harm is free to make their own choices.

Young people use cannabis, like other psychoactive drugs, to feel good, to feel better, to do better or to explore. Trying cannabis out of curiosity, as an experiment, or while socializing with friends, is related to moderate use and lower potential for harm. Using cannabis to cope with daily life, deal with unpleasant feelings, or fit in with a social group has higher potential for harm. This is because dealing with these kinds of issues is associated with frequent and heavier use, less thought about potential harms and little consideration of alternatives for coping such as talking with a parent or trusted adult or physical activity with friends.Evidence suggests that the younger a person is when they start using cannabis and the more often they use, the greater the potential for harms. The legal age to use cannabis in BC is 19. However, our brains do not finish developing until about age 25. Delaying cannabis use until early adulthood may reduce potential harmful effects on the brain.Some young people, especially those with many factors predisposing them to serious and persistent mental health issues, should probably not use cannabis. Cannabis has been associated with an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia in this small group of people. Some people with serious mental health issues have also reported that using cannabis has helped them cope with their illness by helping them feel less anxious or stressed. As in most situations, balancing potential benefits and harms of using cannabis will be key for young people who have serious mental health concerns.Mixing drugs, such as cannabis and alcohol, can also increase the possibility of experiencing harms. Intoxication may be more intense and long lasting and the young person may not appreciate how impaired they are. We often suggest, Not too much, not too often, and only in a safe context as a simple way to gauge your use of any psychoactive substance.As a parent or caring adult, an open respectful relationship with a young person is one of your best resources and ways to prevent harms from substance use. Letting the youth know they can approach you at any time to talk about cannabis, other substances, or anything else of concern to them, says they matter to you and you are ready to listen and engage in dialogue with them. This is a great place to begin addressing anything that might come the young persons way in life!The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not.

whats the difference between mental health and mental illness,"Mental health and mental illness are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing, but they do not. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, There is no health without mental health. In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time.When we talk about mental health, were talking about our mental well-being: our emotions, our thoughts and feelings, our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties, our social connections, and our understanding of the world around us.A mental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples lives in different ways.Health isnt like an on off switch. There are different degrees of health. People move on a continuum ranging from great or good health to so-so health to poor health to illness or disability. For example, some people have good health and have no problems going about their lives. Some people experience serious health problems, and their poor health has a very negative impact on their life. Some people have serious health problems that last for a long time, and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly. Many people fall somewhere in the middletheyre generally in good health, though the occasional problem may come up. Mental health is the same way.Just as someone who feels unwell may not have a serious illness, people may have poor mental health without a mental illness. We all have days where we feel a bit down, or stressed out, or overwhelmed by something thats happening in our lives. An important part of good mental health is the ability to look at problems or concerns realistically. Good mental health isnt about feeling happy and confident 100% of time and ignoring any problems. Its about living and coping well despite problems.Just as its possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, its entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. Thats because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times (episodes) of ill health and times of better or good health.With the right supports and tools, anyone can live wellhowever they define welland find meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals.",mental_health

whats the difference between anxiety and an anxiety disorder,"Anxiety is a normal reaction to many different kinds of events and situations in our lives. Anxiety is one of our internal warning systems that alerts us to danger or other threats and prepares our bodies to fight back or get out of a dangerous situation. (Scientists call this the fight, flight, or freeze response.)A manageable amount of anxiety from time to time can be helpful. For example, it can motivate you to prepare for a test a school or finish a task at work. Even happy events like moving to a new home or celebrating an important milestone can bring up anxietyall of this is just part of being human.Anxiety is a problem when it becomes overwhelming or unmanageable and it comes up unexpectedly. Anxiety disorders are mental illnesses that have a big impact your life. People may avoid going about their daily lives in order to avoid anxiety. They may experience a lot of uncomfortable physical sensations and physical health problems. Many people say that they know their anxiety isnt based in reality, but they feel trapped by their thought and feelings. Anxiety disorders can be treated. Its important to seek help if youre concerned about anxiety in your life.Normal anxiety...Is related to a specific situation or problemLasts only as long as the situation or problem p>Is proportional to the situation or problem p>Is a realistic response to a realistic problem or situation p>When someone experiences an anxiety disorder...Anxiety may come up unexpectedly, for seemingly no reasonThe anxiety response to a situation or problem may be much stronger that they would expectThey may experience a lot of unrealistic anxiety, such as fear of a situation that likely will never happenAnxiety may last for a long time, even when the situation or problem has been resolvedAnxiety may feel impossible to control or manageThey may avoid situations or things that they believe to trigger anxiety symptomsHeres an example of normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder. Many people are a bit nervous about flying, which is a totally normal reaction. Yet, if they have to travel for work, they can can get on a plane without any problems.

whats the difference between anxiety and stress,"Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress is related to the same fight, flight, or freeze response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar.The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that were finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what were stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over.Anxiety, on the other hand, isnt always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life.",mental_health
whats the difference between sadness and depression,"Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life.Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue. A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesnt impact life in a big way, it probably isnt the illness of depression.Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. Its much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesnt usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. Its a real illness, and it is very treatable. Its important to seek help if youre concerned about depression.",mental_health
what is dysthymia or persistent depressive disorder,"Dysthymia, now called persistent depressive disorder or PDD, is a mood disorder. It is related depression (major depressive disorder). The difference between the two is in the number of symptoms and the amount of time that they last. Someone diagnosed with PDD would experience two to four of the symptoms below for at least two years with no periods of wellness during that time, while someone diagnosed with major depressive disorder would experience five or more of the symptoms below for at least two weeks.Symptoms of PDD include:There is a myth that PDD is not as severe an illness as major depressive disorder, but research shows that the disability of the illness, like the ability to work productively and enjoy hobbies, may be as severe in PDD as it is in major depressive disorder. As PDD involves a smaller number of symptoms that last for a very long time, many people begin to assume PDD is just part of their personality rather than an illness that can be effectively treated.

People with SPD may have a hard time relating to others and showing emotions. They may avoid close relationships and prefer to spend their time alone, seeming distant even to close family members. Many people dont respond to strong emotions like anger, even when others try to provoke them. On the outside, people with SPD may seem cold or aloof, showing little emotion.While they have a similar name, schizoid personality disorder isnt the same as schizophrenia.Schizoid personality disorder is believed to be relatively uncommon.

what is antisocial personality disorder,"A personality disorder is a pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours that last for a long time and causes some sort of problem or distress.Antisocial personality disorder or ASPD affects the way people think about the rights of others. Someone with ASPD may disregard laws or expectations, lack remorse when they hurt others or break the law, make reckless decisions, and believe they are superior to others. People may see someone with ASPD as overly dramatic, impulsive, manipulative, and deceitful. Some people may appear charming, at least on the surface. Like all mental illnesses, antisocial personality disorder is a spectrum. Some people may only occasionally act out, while others may break the law often and spend a lot of time in the criminal justice system.ASPD is only diagnosed in adults, but people with ASPD start to have problems with conduct or antisocial behaviours at a young age. They may be diagnosed with conduct disorder during childhood.Treatment for antisocial personality disorder, usually psychotherapy, can help reduce the harms of ASPD and help people build empathy towards others. ASPD is treatable and it may improve as a person approaches middle age.All of us have hurt someone else or acted without thinking of others' needed. Its important to remember that antisocial personality disorder is an enduring pattern around lack of empathy and lack of remorse.

what is obsessivecompulsive personality disorder,"A personality disorder is a pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours that last for a long time and causes some sort of problem or distress.Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or OCPD is about control. People with OCPD have very inflexible thinking and expect everything to be ordered, perfect, and done their ""correct"" way. This happens at the expense of other important things in life, including relationships with others. Work can take priority over every other part of life, too, and people with OCPD may seem excessively dedicated, but may be unable to complete tasks due to perfectionism. They may struggle to delegate and may distrust other peoples contributions. People with OCPD may not tolerate uncertainty and may have a very rigid understanding of the worldsomething is either right or wrong. They may also have a hard time spending money on themselves or others, and they may experience hoarding, the inability to throw away items from their homes. The conflict between the desire for neatness or order and the inability to throw things out may cause a lot of anxiety.While obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have a similar name, they are not the same illness. People with obsessive-compulsive disorder usually understand that their obsessions and compulsions are illogical and usually experience a lot of distress, even though they may not be able to stop obsessions or compulsions. Compulsions are an attempt to reduce anxiety, not to find pleasure. People with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may view their thoughts as part of who they are, see their thoughts as logical, and may find pleasure or benefit in completing compulsive tasks. They may experience a lot of distress when they cant achieve control or the perfectionism they want.Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is one of the most common personality disorders. Treatment may include some combination of psychotherapy, medication, and self-help strategies.

It involves episodes of eating a lot of food in a short amount of time, past the point of feeling full, and feelings of being out of control or unable to stop eating. People who experience binge-eating disorder may binge even when they dont feel hungry. They may feel temporarily comforted by food, and then feel depressed, upset, guilty, or ashamed of their eating. As a result, many people try to keep binge-eating symptoms a secret. You cant tell if someone experiences binge-eating disorder just from the way they look or the way they eat around others.While a lot of people have the experience of eating too much a few times and feeling uncomfortable after, people who experience binge-eating disorder experience many binges for a long period of time.Binge-eating disorder is treatable.

whats the difference between dissociative identity disorder multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia,"Sometimes, people confuse dissociative identity disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder, and schizophrenia. Schizophrenia does mean split mind, but the name was meant to describe the split from reality that you experience during an episode of psychosis, as well as changes in thoughts, emotions, and other functions. Dissociative identity disorder, on the other hand, does cause a split or fragmented understanding of a persons sense of themselves.Dissociative identity disorder is really more about fragmented identities than many different personalities that develop on their own. Most people see different parts of their being as part of the whole person. For people who experience DID, identity fragments may have very different characteristics, including their own history, identity, and mannerisms. A key part of DID is dissociationfeeling detached to the world around you. People who experience DID may have many unexplainable gaps in their memory, forget information theyre already learned, or have difficulties recalling things theyve said or done. Unlike portrayals of DID on TV or in movies, DID may not be obvious to others, and it can take a lot of time to come to the diagnosis.Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that causes hallucinations (sensations that arent real) and delusions (beliefs that cant possibly be true, in addition to other symptoms like jumbled thoughts, jumbled speech, and difficulties expressing emotions. People who experience schizophrenia may hear or feel things that arent real or believe things that cant be real, but these arent separate identities.",mental_health
whats the difference between psychosis and schizophrenia,"Psychosis is a syndrome or group of symptoms. Someone experiencing an episode of psychosis is having a break with reality. Major symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations are sensations that are not real, such as hearing voices or sounds that arent real. Hearing voices is a common hallucination, but hallucinations can be experiences with any sensehearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch. Delusions are strong beliefs that cant possibly be true. Common delusions include the belief that someone is following or monitoring you, or the belief that you have extraordinary powers or abilities. Other symptoms of psychosis include difficulties concentrating, completing tasks, or making decisions. Thoughts may feel jumbled or confused. Some people have a hard time following conversations or speaking clearly. Psychosis can even affect the way people move or express their emotions.Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes psychosis, but schizophrenia also has other symptoms. And it isnt the only cause of psychosis. In some cases, other mental illnesses cause psychosis, including depression, bipolar disorder, dementia and borderline personality disorder. Psychosis may come up during times of extreme stress, a major lack of sleep, or trauma. People who are using or withdrawing from certain drugs or medications may experience psychosis. Psychosis may also be caused by a brain injury, neurological problem, or other health problem. So while psychosis can be a part of schizophrenia, it can be caused by many other things too.Psychosis and schizophrenia are treatable. Its important to seek help as soon as possible.",mental_health

whats the difference between substance use and addiction,"People tend to use the word addiction to mean very different things. I am addicted to shopping might mean only that the speaker likes to shop. On the other hand, He is addicted might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour. When people use the word about psychoactive (mind-altering) substances like alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour.The evidence, however, suggests a quite different picture. While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems, substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations. Many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine, for example. Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies. In fact, substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons: to feel good, to feel better, to improve performance, for cultural spiritual reasons, and to have new experiences.Substance use is more complicated than just good or bad. Its helpful to think of substance use along a continuum, from beneficial use to harmful use. Along the middle of the continuum, substance use may be both beneficial and harmful. You have an enjoyable night out with friends, but feel a little ill the next day. At the far end of the continuum, some people develop dependencethey need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties, problems at home or at work, health problems, or legal problems.In general, substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or othersand how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations. The reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses a substance to have fun, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person uses a substance to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. Managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us. The wisdom of our ancestors suggests a guiding principlenot too much, not too often, and only in safe contexts.",mental_health
how can i find help for an alcohol or drug use problem,"Seeking to make changes in the way you use substances like alcohol or other drugs? This can be an important step!Some people are able to reduce their substance use or quit altogether on their own or with self-help materials. But most of us need support from other peoplefamily members, friends, health professionals, or other people struggling with substance use problems. The right help for you depends on many factors. These include the type of drug you are using, how much and how often, your health and social situation and, of course, your own preferences. Getting help doesnt mean giving up control of shaping your own path. You are still the one who makes the final decisions about the type and degree of change you make.One way to get help is to talk to a doctor you trust and feel comfortable confiding in.

how do i know if im drinking too much,"Sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated. You are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique. No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do. So even though you and your friend may choose to drink, how and why you use alcohol may be different.Those of us who drink, seek benefits from alcohol, not difficulties. But sometimes we start using more, and more often, than makes sense. As a general rule, drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others. Many people imagine this refers to people who consume alcohol all day every day. But even drinking too much on a single occasion can lead to a problem, for instance making a poor decision such as driving while impaired.Whats also important to recognize is the potential for negative consequences related to drinking in various contexts (i.e., places, times and activities) and over time (e.g., coping with chronic problems). You can get personalized feedback related to your pattern of drinking as compared to Canadas Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines via the Alcohol Reality Check screening app. This short, simple screen can be used by people of all ages.All alcohol use involves some risk. The reasons people use alcohol can influence their risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses alcohol to enhance special celebrations, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person drinks to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow.By reflecting on your pattern of drinking you can manage your risk for immediate injury or death, your chances for long-term health consequences such as cancer or heart disease, and your risk of developing habitual patterns of drinking that may lead to these harms.Whenever you decide to drink alcohol, it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible. The following are some useful guidelines to consider.Not too much. Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours.Tip: Drink slowly and alternate between non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages.Not too often. Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time.Tip: Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week, avoiding drinking on some days.Only in safe contexts. Making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcohol-related harm.Tip: If going to a bar, stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options.For information on treatment options and resources throughout BC, call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441.

if cannabis is dangerous why are we legalizing it,"Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol.Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality.When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic.The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm.The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

how can i convince my kids not to use drugs,"You can't. But you can influence their capacity to make good choices in a world where alcohol and other drugs are available. It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship, so they know where to go with questions or problems.Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing open, honest conversation about drugs (or any other subject) makes your child know that what they are thinking, feeling and experiencing matters to you. The goal is to get your child talking and sharing their thoughts and feelings.When young people are asked thoughtful, open-ended questions exploring what they think, it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour. This process of self-reflection is part of developing critical thinking skills, a part of good decision-making. Critical thinking skills are actually an essential part of reducing the risks related to using drugs. Once young people have considered something carefully, they are a lot less likely to act out of impulse or in response to influence.There is no rule about how or where a conversation about alcohol or other drugs should start. Even young children know drugs are a part of our culture. They see people drinking around them and are exposed to drugs on TV and in advertising. This makes it a subject that can be brought up naturally while getting ready for a family celebration where alcohol will be present, or if you are planning to visit a relative who uses tobacco, or while swapping stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day.Talking with teens and young adults about drugs as they make choices on the path into adulthood helps them to develop personal standards, minimize risks and critically assess popular beliefs about drug use. This can be particularly important as they transition to the legal age for using alcohol or cannabis and move out of the family home. While young adults have more independence and more legal rights, parents can continue to be an important sounding board on which to try out their thoughts and ideas.The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

what is the legal status and evidence of cbd oil,"Cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring component of cannabis. It is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use. CBD is not psychoactive, and does not produce the high of THC (tetrahyrocannabinol), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions.All cannabinoids, including CBD, produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. The human body also produces its own cannabinoids. It seems that CBD does not attach directly to receptors. Instead, it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD.Research suggests that CBD may provide relief for chronic pain. Sativex is a proprietary medication that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. There is also some evidence suggesting that CBD may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders. The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia.After researching the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for treating epilepsy, in 2018, the United States FDA approved CBD (Epidiolex) as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures. Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, though further research is needed before introducing CBD into medical practice.There is some initial evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know, and thus slow progression of the illness. Again, more research is needed in this area.Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized, scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs, although nothing significant has yet been recorded. CBD has been found to be generally safe. Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common. As with any other treatment, it is important to monitor your use of CBD and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use.The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

what is the evidence on vaping,"""Vaping"" is the term for using a device where liquids, often flavoured, are turned into vapour (hence, vaping) and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element. The liquid is heated to become a mist, inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. Any residual vapour is exhaled. Vaping devices come in several types, shapes, and sizes, referred to as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or e-hookahs. Vaping liquid (e-liquid, e-juice) consists of a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavour, and nicotine or cannabis, though it may not contain anything. In British Columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products.The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years, while vaping has increased. E-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests, it may help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco.Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. E-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. Long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas.Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and 'smoke' in a less harmful way.Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed, each other, in making good decisions about if, when, or how much to vape. We offer, ""not too much, not too often, and in a safe context"" as one way to think about using any substance.

in your recent exercise faq about how regular fitness can reduce stress you talked about the mind actually resting during exercise is this true,"Have you ever desired some exercise faq? Learning more about exercise and its effects on the body, via exercise faq, can be very helpful. If you want to see real results then an exercise faq is really what you need. Yes, Exercise is a good way to cleanse your mind and emotions. In the recent exercise FAQ, I discussed how if your mind is cluttered, it will become fresh following exercise. If you are exercising properly, your mind will actually be at rest. That's why people who exercise regularly are more productive and creative. Keep in mind that you cannot relieve stress and get the full benefit of exercise if you are in an environment with constant interruption. Explore theexercise faq below and learn what you have always wanted to know about exercise.",fitness
what are some specific growth hormone enhancing exercises,"This is a great way to kick of the exercise faq. Growth hormone enhancing exercises involves the bigger muscles of our body (legs, back, and shoulders). Exercises that will stimulate the release of growth hormone are those that include the larger muscle groups such as squats, lunges, and deadlifts.",fitness
is there any proof that exercise increases longevity,"As a second question in this exercise faq, you couldn't have had a better one.Moderate exercise extends your life. A famous study looking at almost 17,000 male alumni of Harvard University showed that as the activity of the men increased, their death rates decreased. Men who expended at least 2,000 calories doing moderately vigorous exercise, such as playing tennis or jogging, lowered their overall death rates by 25-33% and decreased their risk of coronary artery disease by 41%when compared to the more sedentary alumni.",fitness
what is one single best piece of fitness equipment you recommend,"The best piece of equipment is perhaps the cheapest - the jump rope. It offers cardiovascular benefits and tones the upper body at the same time. Nothing else comes close. Practically speaking, however, the best piece of fitness equipment to purchase is one that fits into your budget and one that you will use regularly.",fitness
should the feet be held down during situps with ones back,"If you have healthy back or strong abdominal muscles, there should not be a difference. If your abdominal muscles become weak (after repetitive exercise), the lower back may arch and cause strain on the low back. To alleviate this, do sit-ups in a bent-knee position.",fitness
can overexercise decrease longevity,"Over-exercising can have some negative effects on your longevity. A famous study of 17,000 Harvard alumni showed that those who exercised over 3,500 kilo calories a week had a slight increase in death rate as compared to the control group. Researchers postulate that over-exercise leads to an increase in cellular oxidation. This, in turn, leads to increased free radical formation, some of which can lead to cellular mutation and cancer.",fitness
does aerobic exercise promote growth hormone release,"Running, race walking, and aerobic exercise stimulates the neuroendocrine system, releasing brain chemicals called endorphins and the catecholamines. These brain chemicals stimulate growth hormone secretion. The only catch is that these exercises have to be done in an intense level (70% to 80% of VO2max). In other words, intensive exercise is equivalent to taking a potent growth hormone release.",fitness
why are you limiting your cardiovascular training to 3045 minutes each workout and not longer,"From an anti-aging perspective, the goal is to maintain our body at an optimum level of exercise into old age. It is not the design of an anti-aging program to prepare you for a marathon, as long training sessions, while good from time to time, can lead to excessive oxidation of muscle cells that in turn can lead to cellular mutation and cancer. Research showed unless you have special needs, the cardiovascular benefit is evident after 20 minutes of continuous aerobics exercise.",fitness
what is my target heart rate zone,"Your target heart rate zone for anti-aging purposes should be between 60% (during the start of the exercise) and 80% (at the peak of the exercise) of your maximum heart rate (which is calculated as 220 minus your age). Occasionally, you can stress your heart by raising the target for a short time. Always consult your doctor first before embarking on any exercise program.",fitness
the gym i go to has over 100 exercise machines are they necessary,"Do not get distracted from the machines. Successful anti-aging exercises and workouts focus on 11 major muscle groups. It is really very simple. All you need to know are 11 exercises, not 50 exercises. The standard machines such as leg extension, leg curl, leg press, bench press, and lat pull down are good. My Anti-Aging exercises, which comprehensively cover all major muscle, are sufficient unless your goal is to make weight training a competitive sport.",fitness
if i dont have 20 minutes to do continuous aerobics exercise can i break it down into two sessions of 10 minutes each,Recent studies have shown that breaking a 20-minute aerobics into two sessions of ten minutes each have cardiovascular benefit almost the same as one session of 20 minutes. Any exercise is better than no exercise.,fitness
how do i keep up my workout during traveling,"The key is planning. Anti-aging exercises can be planned with or without equipment. If you are able to go to a gym where you travel to, great. If you are not, select one of the workout programs that require no equipment at all. The quality of the exercise is the same. Most hotels have a designated fitness area nowadays. Be creative - use a towel to help stretch; use water bottles as weights. The possibilities are endless. Challenge yourself by planning and stick to the exercise program as a priority item. You will succeed.",fitness
what is a growth hormone oriented strength training program like,"Weight training exercises are the best way to enhance growth hormone release. In particular, working the big muscles such as the back, chest, and thigh muscles increase growth hormone levels in the body. A growth hormone oriented strength training program consists of high-intensity heavy lifting, three to five reps, two to five sets at 70-85% of the maximum weight you can handle, three times a week.",fitness
how much time should i realistically expect to spend exercising before i see a transformation of my body,"The goal of an anti-aging exercise program is to optimize and balanced the physical aspect of your body for longevity. It is not designed to transform your body. However, transformations do take place, and most often within the first 12 weeks, depending on how faithful you are in following the system.",fitness
should i listen to music during my workout,"The key to any good workout is the focus. If you can focus on the workout with music on, good for you. Some people like to have quiet environment during their workouts. There is really no rule. Your guiding light should be to do what it takes to give you the maximum amount of concentration to do each workout well.",fitness
is fat burning an important component of the antiaging exercise program,Fat burning comes with any properly done aerobics exercise. The key in anti-aging cardiovascular training is to stress the heart at a suitable level for your age and not over exertion (which may lead to a heart attack). Don't worry about fat burning. Concentrate on the program and everything will take care of itself.,fitness
i dont feel like doing exercises in the morning can i do them at another time,"From an anti-aging perspective, morning is not necessarily the best time to exercise. Research has shown that accidents are more frequent in the morning, perhaps because the joints and muscles are not adequately warmed up. Similarly, heart attacks occur more in those who exercise in the evening, perhaps due to an accumulation of stress through the day and the tiredness of the body. The best time, from an anti-aging perspective, is mid-afternoon when your muscles are warmed up from daily activities and still not too tired.",fitness
can i exercise at home,"The reality is that you don't need a gym full of equipment to realize the benefits of a balanced anti-aging workout. Simple dumbbells will suffice if you have them at home. If you have any equipment, a complete training program is still feasible. You can customize your in-home program easily to fit your needs.",fitness
what are the advantages of using dumbbells for strength training,"Dumbbells permit individualized and optimized alignment of joints, making the exercises both safer and more effective. Furthermore, with the dumbbells, you are exercising in a three-dimensional environment(compared to a machine where it is more linear and two dimensional, so to say), and so your muscle workout is more complete and more real.",fitness
should i eat something before i work out like an energy bar,"If you want to burn the maximum amount of calories and fat, you should exercise on an empty stomach. If you want maximum performance from an athletic viewpoint, an energy bar will help. Anti-aging workouts focus on longevity. Generally speaking, it's important to drink a reasonable amount of water or athletic fluid to keep the body in optimum hydration status, unless you are focused on performance from time to time.",fitness
what is the single most important factor in an antiaging exercise program,"The most important factor is consistency. If you cannot be regular with the program, it does not matter how great your exercise regimen is - you will fail. When you are busy, do less. When you have time, do more. Always do something to keep yourself in the program.",fitness
do i need to exercise more than 1 hour each time,"From an anti-aging perspective, your entire workout - flexibility, cardiovascular, and strength training can all comfortably fit into 60 minutes. One of the common mistakes people make with their workout is that they exercise for hours and get burned out. Long workouts are great from time to time to stress your body and train for athletic events. For anti-aging, the key is consistent exercise year in and year out.",fitness
when is it too late to start an exercise program,"Almost anyone can start an exercise program at any age unless your physician directs you not to. After engaging in a regular exercise program for one year, your body reacts as if you've been exercising your entire life. That is the power of exercise.",fitness
my weight tends to accumulate in my buttocks and thigh area what exercises are particularly good for this area,Jumping rope and stationary biking at very high speeds and low tension or resistance are ideal for these areas. Also essential for reducing lower body fat is calisthenics on a mat - without ankle weights.,fitness
should i ask my friend for advice on exercising or weight training,"Generally speaking, it's better to try to ask an expert for advice. An expert is one who is a professional in the field with at least 10 years of clinical experience. Bad information can lead to injuries, the absolute no-no in anti-aging exercises.",fitness
i am often tired when i come home after a long day should i take it easy and skip my workout,"The next time you come home feeling tired and you don't have enough time to take a short nap, spend 20 minutes on a treadmill and break a sweat. Before you know it, you will be totally revived. Exercise stimulates our nervous system and releases growth hormone into our system for alertness and increases our vitality.",fitness
what are the consequences of overexercising,"Over-exercise can lead to insomnia, depression, and a feeling of constant fatigue. It can also lead to over oxidization of cells from excessive free radical release. While your heart may be in excellent shape from the exercise, too many free radicals can lead to cellular mutations, which may ultimately result in cancer.",fitness
does aerobic exercise lead to an increase in growth hormone levels,Aerobic exercise results in the persistent long-term release of growth hormone in the plasma for two hours or even longer after exercise is stopped. The best part is that only moderate intensity is sufficient.Studies have shown that moderate-intensity of stationary bicycle activity leads to a 145% increase in growth hormone level in our body.,fitness
should i have an exercise buddy,"If you have someone that you can exercise together with, that is wonderful. Try not to rely on one because if you do, you may not go through your routine if he or she is not around. Spend your time educating yourself about fitness and exercise. Let knowledge be your best motivator.",fitness
why is warming up important in an exercise program,"Warming up raises both the general body and the deep muscle temperature through increasing the blood flow. It also stretches collagenous tissue, allowing for greater flexibility and improved performance.From an anti-aging perspective, stretching and warming up reduces the rate of injury and is, therefore, a critical element in a comprehensive workout program.",fitness
how much time is needed for warmup exercises,"Generally speaking, anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes is recommended. The colder the weather, the longer your warm-up should be. Warming up consist of flexibility training exercises and keeping the heart rate at 60%of the maximum heart rate.",fitness
what is a good warm up exercise,The best warm up for most exercisers and sports enthusiasts is stationary biking with minimal resistance.It quickly raises your heart rate and is safe.,fitness
what is the best way to increase muscle tone,"For optimal gains in muscular tone, do three to five sets of ten to thirty reps. Do not increase the number of weights, rather increase the number of reps you perform.",fitness
what is one overall exercise you recommend,"Jumping rope is a wonderful cardiovascular exercise. It tones your upper body muscles and it's easy to do and highly transportable. You can jump rope almost anywhere, anytime, and you only need a rope.",fitness
what is a good cool down exercise,Riding a stationary bike with minimal or no resistance or plane walking at a relaxed speed is highly recommended. Don't forget to drink an adequate amount of fluids as well.,fitness
can i convert fat into muscle by exercising,"This is a great exercise faq. The answer is no, muscle is not converted into fat. But what you can do is to lose the fat through the proper burning of calories in exercise. Concurrently, you build up lean body mass by strength training. The end result is the same - lose fat, gain muscle.",fitness
how do i know if my muscular endurance level is good,"If you can hit a golf ball the same distance on the first hole and on the eighteenth hole (4 hours later), you are in relatively good shape from the muscular endurance point of view.",fitness
how much fat should i have in my body,"A great question for this exercise faq. A certain amount of fat is essential for life. For men, 3-6% of your total body weight must be fat to sustain life. For women, it's 8-12%. The average American male has 25% body fat and women 33%. The optimum anti-aging level for males is 13-18% and women are 18-22 %.",fitness
when i am fit i can eat more and dont gain weight why is that so,"When you are fit, a higher percentage of your body is lean body mass (i.e., muscle). Muscle burns calories 24 hours a day. So while you are sleeping, your muscles are actually burning calories. So even if you eat more, you are quietly burning it off.",fitness
what is the best measure of my fitness level,"Look into the mirror. It's better than the scale. If you look into the mirror and are happy with what you see, chances are that you are probably fit.",fitness
how many calories do i burn during exercise,"Great exercise faq question. The number of calories burned during exercise depends on the intensity and the type of exercise.Generally speaking, the average person burns between 400 - 600 calories for every hour of exercise.",fitness
what is my bmr,"What a good question for an exercise faq. Your BMR (basal metabolic rate) is the minimum amount of energy that your body needs to survive. At rest, you burn about 1 calorie per hour per kg body weight. For the average American, this means about 1,500 calories a day is used by the body just to survive. Add 400 - 1,500 calories, depending on how active you are, and you have the total number of calories you need to maintain your current body weight.",fitness
how much lean body mass do i lose by diet alone without strength training,"You lose anywhere from 50-60% of muscle and lean body mass by diet alone.Loosing lean body mass is not good news. What you want to do is to loose fat while keeping your lean body mass. To do that, you need to perform strength training anti-aging exercises while you are dieting.",fitness
how often should i do aerobics exercise if my goal is to lose weight,"If you are trying to lose weight through the cardiovascular burning of calories, you should do aerobics exercise every day. Try not to skip any days because you need to keep burning the calories that you are consuming each day.",fitness
what is one good rule to remember for exercise,"One good rule for firming and toning the body is: anaerobic-type exercises (such as weight lifting) are best for firming, and aerobic-type exercises (such as running) are best for losing weight and taking away mass from your body.",fitness
what are the best exercises to firm my chest,"There are many exercises in a gym that can help you firm your chest. Some of the popular ones include barbell bench press, dumbbell bench press, dumbbell flies, and the chest press machine. If you do not have access to a gym, push-ups and dips are simple exercises that get results.",fitness
what is the most frequent cause of injuries during exercise,Most injuries occur due to a lack of proper warm-up and flexibility training prior to beginning the exercises.,fitness
what should i do if i feel pain during exercise,"Another great question for the exercise faqPain is a warning sign that something is wrong. When the pain signal comes, the first step is to cease exercise and rest. Many people will attempt to ""tough it out"" and work through the pain. What often results is further injury and chronic pain.",fitness
should heat or ice be applied as the first step after injury,"For the first 24 hours after a muscular or ligamentous injury, consult your doctor and apply ice to decrease swelling. It also helps to keep the injured area elevated to help reduce the swelling.",fitness
does exercise improve growth hormone secretion,"So many of these questions within the exercise faq have been great, as is this one. High-intensity exercise, including strength training at 80% maximum lift and aerobic activities at 80% of maximum heart rate sends a strong signal to the pituitary gland to release growth hormone, which is an anti-aging hormone. Blood levels of growth hormone have been shown to increase by 200-400% following high-intensity exercises.",fitness
what is the hormonal effect of running,"This is the last question of the exercise faq. Running is a quick way to lose fat and change body composition towards an increase of lean body mass. As you gain more lean body mass, you are metabolically more active and release more growth hormone for anti-aging purposes. Running, in and of itself, at a moderate pace also stimulates growth hormone release.",fitness
muscle weighs more than fat true or false,"False. A pound is a pound regardless of whether the pound is fat or muscle. The truth about muscle is that it's denser than fat and takes up a smaller amount of space in the body. In fact, scientists estimate that 1 pound of muscle occupies about 22% less space than 1 pound of fat!",fitness
maintaining physical fitness requires major lifestyle changes true or false,"False. Fitness can be achieved through small changes in what you eat and your level of activity. It's really that simple. Remember that you can start out slowly; work your way up to a higher level of activity, and implement more dietary changes over time. Patience is essential. Don't try to do too much too soon, and don't quit before you have a chance to experience the rewards of improved fitness and a healthy diet!",fitness
no pain no gain is a workout myth true or false,"True. ""No pain, no gain"" is a workout myth because while some muscle aches and pains are normal when beginning a new fitness routine, many types of pain are bad for you. According to Jeffrey Berg, an orthopedic surgeon and team physician for the Washington Redskins, ""There are other aches and pains, such as joint pain, bone pain, muscle strains, and ligament or tendon strains, which are bad, and you should back off of because they'll get worse if you ignore them."" He adds, ""Always ease into an exercise plan to avoid injury. The recommendation is if you're healthy and you know it, you can start exercising, but err on the side of being too slow than too fast to avoid injury.""",fitness
weight loss should be the most important goal of fitness and exercise true or false,"False. It's a fact that weight loss is the main reason people exercise at all, but losing weight is certainly not the only benefit of exercising and should therefore not be the main goal. If you're starting a fitness program, don't make weight loss your only goal! Strive to feel better or to have more energy. You'll get more out of your program if you notice the small payoffs that exercise provides in a very short amount of time.",fitness
you should warm up before exercising true or false,"True. Each workout should begin with a warm-up. A warm-up should include 5 to 10 minutes of exercise such as walking, slow jogging, knee lifts, arm circles, and or trunk rotations. Warming up is important to help prevent injury. It also helps to maximize benefits from exercise.",fitness
the more you sweat during a workout the more fat the body is burning true or false,"False. ""This is false,"" says Cedric Bryant, chief exercise physiologist for the American Council on Exercise. ""The amount you sweat is indicative of your body's ability to maintain its normal body temperature. You sweat when your body starts to store heat so you can experience cooling via evaporation of that sweat. So it doesn't correlate to how much energy, or calories, is being expended.""",fitness
a desirable level of fitness can be achieved through as little as how many workouts per week,"3. Frequency, duration, intensity, and what kinds of exercises you do should be determined by what you are trying to accomplish. Your goals, your present fitness level, age, health, skills, interests, and convenience are among the factors you should consider. Still, you can reach your fitness goals in as little as three workouts per week!",fitness
older adults are least likely to benefit from physical activity true or false,False. The best thing about regular physical activity is that everyone can benefit from it. You are never too old to enjoy the benefits of regular physical activity! Being physically active can prevent and help treat many of the most common chronic medical conditions associated with aging. Physical activity is one of the most important steps older adults can take to maintain physical and mental health and quality of life.,fitness
active people need extra protein or protein supplements to build muscles true or false,"False. Muscles develop from training and exercise. Extra servings of protein in foods or protein supplements do not assist in muscle development. A certain amount of protein is needed to help build the muscles, but a nutritious, balanced diet that includes 6-7 ounces from the meat bean egg group and 2-3 servings of dairy every day will supply all of the protein that the muscles need.",fitness
even moderate exercise reduces the risk of heart disease diabetes hypertension and obesity true or false,"True. Research shows that exercise is the silver bullet for a better quality of life. Not only does regular exercise aid in weight loss, it reduces your risk for several chronic diseases and conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure (hypertension), stroke, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis.",fitness
crunches and situps are the best way to lose belly fat true or false,"False. Forget doing hundreds of crunches and sit-ups in an effort to lose belly fat. The truth is that on their own, they are not likely to help the body lose that stubborn gut. Here is what works: a full-body exercise routine that builds lean muscle all over. The best plan for this is regular exercise, resistance training, and a healthy, calorie-controlled diet.",fitness
does muscle burn calories even when the body is at rest,"Yes. When you exercise, you use muscle. This helps build muscle mass, and muscle tissue burns more calories than body fat, even when the body at rest. According to Christopher Wharton, PhD, a certified personal trainer and researcher with the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, 10 pounds of muscle would burn 50 calories in a day spent at rest, while 10 pounds of fat would burn 20 calories.",fitness
working out at a gym will provide the best results true or false,"False. Believe it or not, you can skip the gym. There are plenty of exercises you can do at home or outdoors using your own body weight and gravity. Examples of some easy at-home exercises are push-ups, planks, jumping jacks, squats, and lunges.",fitness
the workout term aerobic exercise is interchangeable with which term,"Cardio. The term aerobic exercise or aerobics is interchangeable with the term cardio. Cardio refers to cardiovascular fitness exercises. Both terms refer to brisk physical activity that requires the heart and lungs to work harder to meet the body's increased oxygen demand. Aerobic exercise (cardio) promotes the circulation of oxygen through the blood. Examples of aerobic exercise include running, swimming, and cycling.",fitness
strength training such as lifting weights will result in a bulky appearance true or false,"False. It is not true that lifting weights will result in a bulky appearance. According to Cedric Bryant, chief exercise physiologist for the American Council on Exercise, ""This is a myth that deters a lot of women from strength training, when in fact, what determines the amount of muscle bulk a person has is largely dependent on genetic factors.""",fitness
is working out in the morning better for you,"You should exercise at a time that suits you and your body. Theres no evidence to suggest that an early morning workout is better for you, but some people are just more efficient at this time. Youll get results regardless of the time of day, as long as it works for you.",fitness
should i approach my sessions with a plan,"Yes, this will help you get the most out of your workout. Decide which muscle groups you want to work on, whether youre doing a strength session or a HIIT workout and what equipment youll need. Then, think about how many reps and sets youre going to perform. That way, you wont waste time procrastinating and youll work harder as a result.",fitness
do i need to work out every day,"A good workout week doesnt necessarily mean training every day. Three to four gym or home workouts each week is enough if you work as hard as you can in each session. Try to balance the week with a mix of cardio, HIIT, strength and yoga or Pilates. However, when it comes to being active you should aim to move as much as you can every day  whether thats with brisk walking, jogging, swimming, gardening or putting your all into the housework!",fitness
how long do i need to work out for,"This depends on your fitness levels, what type of training youre doing and what intensity youre training at. Just remember, something is always better than nothing. If you only have 30 minutes, try to fit in a quick HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) workout or go for a run.If youre doing a strength workout, set aside more time for warming up and mobilising to help avoid injury and make sure youre getting enough rest between sets. Either way, you definitely dont need to be slogging it out for hours!",fitness
do i need to vary my workout to see results,"If you want to see real change in your body you need to mix up your routine. The body quickly adapts to exercise and if you continue to do the same workout or use the same weights, it will plateau as it stops responding to the training stimulus. Increase frequency, intensity or the type of training as often as you can.",fitness
how do i get a sixpack,"Doing 100 sit-ups a day wont guarantee a defined set of abs; youll need to do a combination of things. Reducing body fat should be first on the agenda  you may have the strongest set of abdominal muscles but if your body fat percentage is too high, you wont be able to see them.Be sure to include some fat-burning HIIT training and cardio in your routine. However, diet is arguably the most important factor if you want to get lean. Use apps such as My Fitness Pal to track your calorie intake and if weight loss is your goal, ensure you are in a calorie deficit (burning more calories than you eat).When youve reached your body fat goals, its time to target the abdominals and increase their muscle mass through your training. Great core exercises include plank variations, bicycle crunches and cable rotations, or try abs-specific classes at the gym.",fitness
what type of training do i need to do to increase muscle mass,"If you want to build muscle, youll need to start weight training. Lifting heavy weights effectively rips the muscle fibres and as the body repairs, it replaces damaged muscle fibres to form new strands. As a result, this increases the thickness and size of the muscle.Choose heavier weights for lower reps and take a longer rest between sets. Its important to train the muscle groups you want to build a few times per week. And dont forget to increase your calorie intake  you need to feed muscles if you want them to grow.",fitness
what type of training do i need to do to lose weight,"Generally, cardio training such as swimming or running will burn the most calories per session. Weight training will help you burn more calories over the course of the day  muscle burns more calories at rest than other tissues, including fat, and therefore speeds up your resting metabolism.Researchers at the University of Colorado have found that HIIT exercise burns 25%-30% more calories than a steady-state exercise session such as a run. Therefore, combining cardio, weights and HIIT-specific training alongside a diet that will leave you in a calorie deficit is the most effective route to weight loss.",fitness
what type of training do i need to get stronger,"Strength can mean different things to different people. For some it can mean being able to do one pull up, for others it might be reaching a deadlift PB, which is why it is important to train for your goals. In order to gain strength in a targeted area, you need to gradually increase your volume (times per week and reps) and the intensity of those sessions. Try setting yourself realistic targets each week so that you have something specific to aim for.",fitness
how often do i need to rest,"Ensure you have at least one rest day per week to allow your body to regenerate and repair, so you can come back stronger.",fitness
when should i stretch and how often,"Start with some dynamic stretching (active muscular stretching such as walking lunges or jogging with high knees) before a workout. Then, do static stretches such as a standing thigh stretch or side lunge for post-workout recovery, focusing on the muscles youve worked. This will decrease your risk of injury, improve blood flow and circulation, increase your range of motion and improve muscle function. You can never stretch too much!",fitness
whatâs the best way to help sore muscles,"Diet plays a vital role in the rate at which your body can recover  protein is crucial for decreasing muscle damage and soreness after a workout, so make sure to fuel up properly. Rest and plenty of sleep will also give the body time to repair.Treat yourself to a bath with Epsom salts, which are packed with magnesium that will gently relax muscles. Or try foam rolling, which acts as a self-massage and prevents damage to the connective tissue between the muscles.",fitness
how and when do i need to use a foam roller,"Foam rolling acts as a deep tissue massage, which will help to improve mobility and flexibility. Rolling pre-workout will prepare your body for exercise and increase circulation to the muscles you are preparing to train. Post-workout, foam rolling is a great recovery tool, as it removes lactic acid (a waste product your body produces during exercise) from your muscles.",fitness
how does exercise help mental health,"Research has shown that exercise can help to reduce stress, improve your self-confidence, alleviate anxiety and improve concentration. Plus, it releases endorphins, which encourage feelings of happiness.Be careful not to over train, as this can put your body and mind under stress, raising levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Therefore a balanced exercise plan is key.",fitness
what health benefits can i get from eating more fruits and vegetables,"By eating more fruits and vegetables you will get more essential nutrients into your diet. These nutrients include vitamins, minerals and other beneficial plant compounds such as phytochemicals that are found in fruits and vegetables.Fruits and vegetables are also rich in fiber. Fiber helps you feel full, lowers your cholesterol, can reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes and is great for your gut (fiber feeds your good gut microbes). When you feel full you are less inclined to continue eating, so eating more fiber can help you reduce the amount of food you eat without leaving you feeling hungry. It can also help you reduce your intake of unhealthy or less than nutritious foods such as heavily processed foods that tend to be high in sodium, sugars and saturated fat (and low in fiber).Finally, eating more healthy plants can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and type II diabetes.",nutrition
how does a plantrich diet aid in the prevention of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases cancer and type ii diabetes,"Eating a healthy plant-rich diet helps to prevent chronic diseases in several ways.First of all, a high-fiber diet, like what you get from eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, reduces your risk of cardiovascular disease, colon and other cancers, and type II diabetes. Fiber helps to naturally lower blood cholesterol levels, which is thought to be one way that it helps with cardiovascular disease. Fiber is also the preferred food source for a healthy gut microbiota, which researchers are linking to several positive health benefits.Your risks of developing several different types of cancers are reduced by eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables. These include cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach and lung. These cancer risk-reduction effects are thought to happen partly because of the antioxidant properties of fruits and vegetables. Another possible mechanism by which non-digestible fiber in plant-rich foods reduces cancer risk is that it promotes beneficial gut bacteria that metabolize the fiber into beneficial short-chain fatty acids. These short-chain fatty acids have a range of health benefits, from reducing blood pressure to lowering inflammation and cellular stress in the brain. They are anti-inflammatory and they can even encourage colorectal cancer cells to self-destruct via a process known as apoptosis.Having a plant-based Mediterranean-style diet can also help reduce the incidence of diabetes. A Mediterranean-style diet involves eating abundant fruits and vegetables along with olive oil, legumes, whole grains and nuts, and a small amount of poultry and fish. Wine, whole fat dairy and red meat can be included in small amounts. This eating style can protect healthy people from getting diabetes and also protects some people at risk of diabetes, like those with cardiovascular disease and women at risk of gestational diabetes.A plant-based Mediterranean-style diet works by helping to manage blood sugar, insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors such as overweight obesity, blood pressure, cholesterol and inflammation.Other studies show that eating a healthy diet plus physical activity helps to reduce the onset of type II diabetes in people who are at risk.",nutrition
how much is a serving of fruit or vegetables what does a single serving of fruit  vegetables look like,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture measures servings of fruit and vegetables by the cup. This means that one cup (8 fl. oz or 250 mL) is one serving (except for dried fruit and leafy greens).Examples of one serving of fruit include:1 small apple1 large banana, orange, or peach1 medium pear or grapefruit1 cup of cut or pureed fruit (e.g. applesauce)1 cup of berries (frozen or fresh)1 cup of 100% pure juice* cup of dried fruitExamples of one serving of vegetables include:1 large pepper, tomato, or ear of corn1 medium potato (boiled or baked)2 medium carrots2 large stalks of celeryv1 cup of cut, raw, boiled, or roasted vegetables2 cups of lettuce or raw spinach1 cup of tomato juice* While 100% pure fruit juice can be part of your daily fruit recommendations, choosing whole fruit is preferred because it has the added health benefits of fiber.",nutrition
how many servings of fruits  vegetables should i be eating per day,"Weve all heard that we need to eat our fruits and vegetables. But how many servings do we need?According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, an average woman should eat 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit and 2 to 2.5 cups of vegetables per day. For men, that number is 2.5 to 3 cups per day.A simple way to increase your vegetable intake is to include at least one vegetable with every meal and have them as snacks. See additional tips on adding more vegetables to your day here.",nutrition
should my intake of fruits  vegetables and other nutrients change as i age,"As we age our nutritional needs change slightly when it comes to fruits and vegetables.Women aged 19-30 who get 30 minutes or less of moderate physical activity per day( should have about 2 cups of fruit and 2.5 cups of vegetables per day. After the age of 30, women need a bit less fruit (1.5 cups), but still need 2.5 cups of vegetables per day. After the age of 50, women need 1.5 cups of fruit and 2 cups of vegetables each day.Men who get 30 minutes or less of moderate physical activity per day* should get about 2 cups of fruit each day regardless of their age. When it comes to vegetables, men need 3 cups per day until about age 50, after that 2.5 cups per day is enough.*Women and men who are more active may need an additional half-cup of fruit or vegetables per day.",nutrition
do canned fruits pure fruit juice and vegetable juice count,"According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, any fruit or vegetable or 100% juice counts toward your daily fruit and vegetable intake. This includes fresh fruits and vegetables that are raw, cooked, whole, cut or pureed. It also includes fruits and vegetables that are canned, frozen, mashed or dried dehydrated.Having said that, its always a better choice to eat whole, raw fruit rather than juice. Whole fruits have additional health benefits of dietary fiber.Also, when choosing canned fruit, choose ones that add 100% fruit juice or water instead of those canned in syrup. Syrup has added sugar that we dont want too much of. Ideally, the sugar we eat and drink should come naturally from fruits, vegetables and unsweetened dairy products, and not added sugars.Be especially cautious when purchasing fruit yogurts and canned fruit  look at the ingredients list of these products for added sugar that you dont need in your diet. Sugar goes by many names: rice syrup, corn syrup, dextrin, dextrose, sucrose, fructose, agave nectar, fruit juice concentrate, invert sugar, malt syrup, malodextrin, palm sugar, turbinado. Greek and unsweetened yogurts and unsweetened canned fruits are typically best, combining higher amounts of dietary fiber without added sugars. You can always add raw fruit and a bit of honey to your plain yogurt.",nutrition
what if i eat fruit products or juices sweetened with artificial sweeteners will this have the same effect on my health as eating unsweetened fruit products and why do i crave the sweetness so much,"By Margarida Martins Oliveira, Ph.D.The human taste sensory system includes five primary taste qualities: sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami. From an evolutionary perspective, it is postulated that it functions as a gatekeeper of the digestive system to ensure that we consume essential nutrients for survival while rejecting potentially harmful or toxic foods. The sweet taste perception functions primarily to detect plant-based simple sugars. Our strong attraction to sugars reflects our evolutionary need for a way to identify readily available sources of metabolic fuel, such as glucose.The sensory pleasure derived from tasting sweet substances has an innate basis. The liking for sweet taste is intensified during childhood, a period of maximal growth when there is a nutritional need for energy-producing foods that are high in sugars, minerals and vitamins (e.g., mothers milk and fruits).Tasting something sweet leads to the activation of pleasure-generating brain circuitry (hedonic liking). More specifically, the information generated from the oral cavity is forwarded to the brain and transmitted to the primary taste cortex, whose neurons relay information to pathways involved in the central processing of the food reward along the dopaminergic midbrain. The activation of the brains reward pathway consequently releases the neurotransmitter dopamine in several other brain structures such as the orbitofrontal cortex, caudate nucleus and the amygdala.Interestingly, a clinical study has shown while both sugar and high intensity sweeteners were able to activate the primary taste pathway in the brain, only sugars were able to activate a significant response in the brains reward pathway. However, individuals who regularly consume diet soda (which contains artificial sweeteners) show alterations in reward processing of sweet taste. Diet soda drinkers had greater activation to sweet taste. In this case, the brains reward system was incapable of distinguishing between sugar and the artificial sweetener. Research into sweetness preference demonstrates that the more often an individual is exposed to sweet foods, the higher the preference for sweet taste. The more often a sweetened beverage is consumed, the higher is the liking for the sweet taste in orange juice, for example. This can lead to overconsumption of sweet foods and beverages. This could have major health implications associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes.Besides influencing food preferences, sweet taste perception influences the type and amount of food consumed. Curiously, a population study revealed that total energy intake and absolute intake of carbohydrate (i.e., starch, total sugar, fructose and glucose) correlated negatively with sweet taste intensity and positively with hedonic liking of suprathreshold glucose concentrations, in a dose-dependent manner. So your liking for sweet has implications for how much energy and carbohydrates you consume.Regarding dietary guidelines, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive sweeteners and nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) when consumed within a (healthy) eating plan. In addition, lowering the intake of simple sugars in healthy adults has been shown to increase the perceived sweetness of sugar-added foods. Thus, the take home message is to try to reduce sweet-tasting products such as sweetened foods or beverages, whether sweetened with sugar, natural or artificial sweeteners. Real sugar or not, sweetness moderation is key for a healthy brain-reward response.More references:Why do we like sweet taste: A bitter tale?

what does a balanced fruit intake look like,"by Leesa KlichDifferent fruits have different nutrients, so its a good idea to eat a variety of fruit.For example, you can find more of the essential mineral potassium in fruits like bananas, prunes, dried peaches and apricots, and orange juice. Foods rich in potassium can help to lower blood pressure and may reduce the risk of kidney stones and help to decrease bone loss.Vitamin C is found in many fruits like citrus (e.g. orange), kiwi and strawberries. Not only does vitamin C help to improve absorption of iron, but it also helps the body to heal wounds.Most fruits are rich in antioxidants, but in particular berries, cherries, peaches, pears, plums, apples, etc. High levels of dietary antioxidants may be part of the reason why diets high in fruit are associated with lower risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Fruit also contains other health-promoting compounds like the flavonoids fisetin and quercetin. Fisetin is found in apples, grapes, kiwi, peaches and strawberries. When given to mice in high doses, fisetin has reduced the inflammation levels in these animals, improved tissue function and extended their lifespan.",nutrition
should i be focusing on eating certain kinds of vegetables over others,"by Leesa KlichThe U.S. Department of Agriculture categorizes vegetables into five major groups:Red and orange vegetables (e.g. tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, etc.)Starchy vegetables (e.g. potatoes, peas, corn, etc.)Other vegetables (e.g. cauliflower, celery, peppers, mushrooms, etc.)Dark-green vegetables (e.g. leafy greens, broccoli, etc.)Beans and peas (e.g. black beans, kidney beans, etc.)A healthy balanced vegetable intake includes a variety of vegetables. The order that they are laid out above shows you how much of each to get, in decreasing order. Over the course of a week, the groups of vegetables you should get the highest amounts of are red and orange vegetables and starchy vegetables. After that aim for other vegetables, dark green vegetables and some beans (high in fiber, protein and also carbohydrates) and peas as well. You dont need to have all five types of vegetable every day, but mix it up so you can have all of them by the end of the week.",nutrition
what vitaminsminerals do fruits and vegetables have that are good for me,"by Leesa KlichFruits and vegetables have a lot of vitamins, minerals and other health-promoting compounds. Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that everyone needs every day to be healthy.Some of the vitamins found in fruits and vegetables include:Vitamin AVitamin CFolate (vitamin B9)Vitamin A helps keep your skin healthy, keeps your bones strong and helps with night vision. Its also important for your immune system. Some important vegetable sources of vitamin A include orange vegetables like carrots, pumpkin, squash and sweet potatoes. Vitamin A is also found in tomatoes and leafy greens like spinach, collards and kale. Fruit sources of Vitamin A include mangoes, cantaloupe and watermelon. (More info on Vitamin A here.)Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that helps the body absorb iron as well as heal wounds. It helps cuts and wounds heal properly and helps keep your teeth and gums healthy. Some of the vegetables high in vitamin C include sweet peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, leafy greens, cabbage, snow peas and tomatoes. It is also found in fruits such as cantaloupe, kiwi, citrus, pineapples, strawberries and watermelon. (More info on Vitamin C here.)Folate, also known as vitamin B9, is essential for proper development of the brain and spinal cord during pregnancy. It helps the body make red blood cells and is a critical nutrient during pregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Folate is found in several vegetables but particularly in asparagus, broccoli and leafy greens like spinach and collard, as well as in beans and lentils. It is also found in fruits such as strawberries and cantaloupe. More info on folate here.)Some of the minerals found in fruits and vegetables include:CalciumIronMagnesiumPotassiumCalcium is essential for healthy bones, teeth, muscles and nerves. It is found in leafy greens like spinach and collards as well as in soybeans.Iron is important for healthy blood and energy needed for all cells of the body. Its role is to help the blood transport oxygen from your lungs throughout your body. It is found in spinach, beans and lentils.Magnesium is used by over 300 enzymes in the body and is also necessary for healthy bones. It is found in leafy greens like spinach, squash, beans and lentils.Potassium helps to maintain healthy blood pressure and reduces the risk of kidney stones and bone loss. Vegetables rich in the mineral potassium include potatoes (sweet and white), tomatoes (and tomato sauce*), beet greens, spinach, broccoli, soybeans and legumes such as white beans, lentils and kidney beans. Potassium is also found in fruits such as bananas and kiwi.*Watch out for high sodium content and even added sugars in some canned vegetables. Opt for fresh or frozen vegetables if possible.Fruits and vegetables also contain a group of micronutrients called polyphenols. These are found in apples, berries, citrus, plums, broccoli, broad beans, onions and other fruits and vegetables. Many studies show that a diet high in polyphenol-rich foods and drinks protects against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.Another health-promoting group of compounds found in vegetables are the organosulfur compounds like isothiocyanates (i.e. glucosinolates, sulforaphanes, etc.). These compounds have been found to help with inflammation, stress responses and detoxification. They also have antioxidant, antimicrobial and even potentially anticarcinogenic properties*. They are found in the Brassicaceae family of plants that includes broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and kale.",nutrition
can i take supplements of the above vitamins and minerals instead of eating fruits and vegetables,"by Leesa KlichVitamin and mineral supplements arent a good substitute for a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables. For example, research on people taking multivitamins has shown no effect on the risks of any chronic diseases. Increasing your fruit and vegetable intake has health benefits beyond that of just their vitamins and minerals.Plus, dietary supplements are not recommended for the prevention or treatment of diseases and may have unwanted side effects*.There are some circumstances where your health care professional may recommend specific supplements for you, for example if you are pregnant, if you are on a restricted diet, and once you reach the age of 50.*Its probably best to get strong antioxidants and compounds such as isothiocyanates through the foods that you eat as opposed to supplements. Isolated chemicals can potentially target a single cellular response response or metabolic pathway that could possibly be detrimental if you are already battling a cancer that has co-opted this response or pathway for its own growth, for example. Particularly if you are being treated for cancer, ask your physician before taking any given supplement.",nutrition
how can i get enough iron eating mostly fruits and vegetables,"by Leesa KlichIron is an essential mineral that is important to help your red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body.How much iron do you need? Men and post-menopausal women need about 8 mg day. If youre a menstruating woman you need about 18 mg day.How do you get enough iron? While meat, poultry, seafood and eggs are known to contain higher amounts of iron, many fruits and vegetables contain it too. While the iron in animal foods is easier to absorb, there is a strategy to help the plant-based iron become more absorbable.Some fruits and vegetables that are higher in iron include:AsparagusSpinachDried fruit (e.g. apricots, prunes, and raisins)To help your body absorb more of the plant-based iron from these fruits and vegetables, eat them with other foods that are higher in vitamin C.Food higher in vitamin C include:Citrus fruits (e.g. oranges, tangerines),StrawberriesKiwiSweet peppersBroccoliYou can combine iron-rich and vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables by having different side dishes of iron-rich and vitamin-C rich foods at the same meal, having fruit for dessert after your iron-rich vegetable meal, or even making a salad combining them, for example spinach with orange segments and or strawberries.",nutrition
where can i find the freshest fruits and vegetables in my area,by Leesa KlichSome of the freshest fruits and vegetables would come from your own or a neighbors garden. Local farmers often sell very fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets.You can find local farmers markets in the USA and Canada.You next best option is your grocery store. There may be a certain one that consistently has the freshest fruits and vegetables. You can also ask the people working there when they usually get fresh produce delivered to them.,nutrition
raw fruits and vegetables are expensive are there cheaper options,"by Leesa KlichSome raw fruits and vegetables are expensive, especially ones that are already peeled, chopped and prepared for you. Look for fruits and vegetables that are in season and on sale. Another strategy is to only buy what you need and eat them all while theyre still fresh.But you dont have to have only fresh raw fruits and vegetables. Try them canned or frozen  remember to look for fruits that are canned in 100% juice without added syrup or sugars, and vegetables that are low in sodium with minimal added salt (low sodium cans and raw frozen vegetables). You can stock up on these when theyre on sale too.Another strategy is to freeze leftovers so that you can eat them later.",nutrition
what types of fruits have the most and least amounts of natural sugars should i be worried about my sugar intake when eating raw fruits,"by Leesa KlichFruits that have the highest amounts of natural sugars by weight are dried fruits  apples, berries, dates, raisins, etc.When it comes to raw fruit, ones that are higher in sugar include:GrapesPomegranatesMangoesCherriesBananasFruits that are lowest in natural sugars are:AvocadoesRhubarbLemons and limesCranberriesRaspberriesEven though fruit contains sugar and overconsumption of sugar promotes obesity, fruit tends to have an anti-obesity effect. Fruit consumption also reduces obesity-related diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In fact, the CDC recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for healthy weight management.",nutrition
what vegetables  fruits are most ketogenic diet friendly,"by Leesa KlichThe ketogenic diet is very low in carbohydrates and high in fat. The premise behind it is to restrict consumption of carbohydrates (our bodys main fuel source) and after several days we adapt to using fat for fuel. When fat is broken down it is turned into ketone bodies that can then be used as an alternate fuel source for most of our cells, including cells in our muscles and brain.While there isnt a widely accepted definition of how many carbohydrates is very low, most studies use a guideline of 20-50 grams of carbohydrates per day to classify a diet as being ketogenic.Many fruits and vegetables have high amounts of carbohydrates. One medium banana has 27 grams, for example.Some fruits and vegetables that are ketogenic diet friendly (i.e. lower in carbohydrates) include leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cucumbers, bell peppers, celery, asparagus, mushrooms, summer squash and avocados. Small amounts of berries may also be ketogenic diet friendly.For more on eating fruits and vegetables while on a ketogenic diet, and why the carbohydrates they contain are much different than the carbs in unrefined grains and foods with added sugars, read here.",nutrition
how about grains nuts and legumes do servings of these categories of foods substitute the daily recommendations for fruits and vegetables,"by Leesa KlichGrains are their own category and do not substitute for fruits and vegetables. The grains category includes rice, oats and quinoa, as well as grain-based foods like breads, cereals, crackers and pasta.The fruits and vegetables category includes legumes like beans and peas. Legumes are unique in that they can count as either fruits and vegetables or protein because their nutrient profile is similar to both.Nuts and seeds are part of the protein category along with seafood, meats, poultry, eggs and legumes. They cannot substitute for fruits and vegetables.",nutrition
im allergic to some fruits  vegetables what should i do to still get the recommended intake,"by Leesa KlichSome allergies are a nuisance while others can be life-threatening. Most food allergy symptoms appear within two hours of eating a food, although serious allergies can be immediate. If you are having a serious reaction you should immediately go to the nearest emergency room.Over 160 foods can cause allergic reactions, however eight are responsible for 90 percent of fool allergic reactions and are classified as major food allergens. These are milk, wheat, peanuts, eggs, soybeans, fish (e.g. cod, bass), crustacean shellfish (e.g. crab, lobster, shrimp) and tree nuts (e.g. almonds, walnuts). Corn can also cause allergies.Allergies to fruits and vegetables are not as common as the allergies above, but some people with pollen and plant allergies may suffer cross-reactions with compounds in foods that look like plant allergens to the body. For example, people who react to birch pollen may also react to proteins in apples, plums, kiwis, carrots, celery, potatoes, hazelnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, and even spices such as oregano, basil and dill. These allergies, however, can come and go depending on the time of year.If you think you have an allergy its best to speak with an allergist. Rather than avoid all fruits and vegetables that you suspect your body reacts to, you can get allergy tests throughout the year to determine exactly what is bothering you. Even those who are allergic to fruits and vegetables still should try to get the recommended number of servings each day, so if you must avoid certain ones, make sure to substitute for others in the category. Your allergist can test you (via a skin prick test for example) for allergies to specific fruits and vegetables, if you suspect you have a food allergy.",nutrition
apart from food intolerances and allergies what are some examples of foods that should be avoided by individuals with certain health conditions,"by Leesa KlichIt is recommended that most people avoid foods that are processed and foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, salt and sugar. It is also recommended that you limit their intake of red meat, processed meats and sugar-sweetened drinks. Following these recommendations can lower your risk of getting cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Even those with diabetes and cardiovascular disease can see improvement by avoiding these foods.Here is a list of foods that you might want to avoid if you have GER or GERD (reflux).Another important consideration is not just what you eat, but how much you eat and when you eat, particularly with regards to weight management and management of related diseases. Having healthy foods in adequate portion sizes, ideally consumed primarily during daylight hours, is key to optimal health.",nutrition
what are examples of diets that are usually recommended for individuals with cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease kidney diseases andor liver diseases,"by Leesa KlichA balanced diet and adequate nutrient intake are important for people with cancer. Nutrition-based interventions, exercise and even mindful eating practices can be leveraged to reduce some side effects from treatment. The main things to keep in mind are to maintain a healthy body weight and strength. Malnutrition is a risk for some people with cancer because the condition and its treatment can affect a persons taste, smell, appetite and ability to eat enough food and absorb nutrients from food. In this case, eating enough protein and maintaining an adequate calorie intake are very important to help with energy levels and the ability to fight infections and heal wounds. This may include adding extra dairy or eggs to the diet.Depending upon side effects, there may be different nutrition recommendations. Some cancer patients, such as breast cancer patients, tend to gain weight during treatment. This weight gain has consistent negative impacts on treatment effectiveness and recurrence, such that nutrient restriction (particularly cutting out added sugars) and even time-restricted eating schedules may be beneficial.For all three types of diabetes (type I, type II and gestational), there are guidelines to help you eat well. Recommendations include eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy. Avoid foods that are higher in calories, saturated and trans fats, sugar and salt. Drink water instead of sweetened beverages. These recommendations can be made easier by making sure half of your plate is fruits and vegetables, one quarter is lean protein and the last quarter is whole grains.When it comes to cardiovascular disease, the recommended diet includes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, fish, lean meats and poultry, eggs, nuts and seeds, legumes and vegetable oils (with the exception of coconut and palm oils). Avoid foods and drinks that are higher in salt, saturated and trans fats, added sugars and alcohol.There is also a diet specifically designed for high blood pressure called DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). This diet has been shown to lower blood pressure and reduce blood cholesterol. Instead of recommending specific foods, it provides daily and weekly nutrition goals to reduce intake of saturated and trans fats and sodium while increasing intake of potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber and protein. In fact, the DASH diet can also reduce the risk of kidney stones.To reduce the risk of kidney stones, reduce your intake of animal protein and sodium while increasing your intake of calcium from foods. Certain kidney stones created from oxalate can be reduced by reducing intake of oxalate-containing foods like nuts, peanuts, rhubarb, spinach and wheat germ.For nonalcoholic liver diseases, risk can be reduced with a few dietary recommendations. First, replace saturated and trans fats with unsaturated fats, particularly omega-3 fats. Avoid excess alcohol and foods and drinks high in sugar.",nutrition
other than protein what are some other important nutrients that are abundant in meats as compared to fruits and vegetables and how can a vegetarian diet include enough of these,"by Leesa KlichVegetarian eating patterns based on whole foods can be very healthy and reduce ones risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes and some types of cancers. However, there are a few nutrients that may be too low in vegetarian diets; these are protein, calcium, iron and vitamin B12.Meat is known to be a great source of protein. Plant-based sources of protein include beans and lentils, oatmeal, nuts and quinoa. Meat-free sources include eggs and dairy.Calcium is found in the following plants: leafy greens, broccoli, almonds, sesame seeds and fortified foods like plant-based milks, orange juice and tofu. Meat-free sources of calcium include dairy products.Iron is one key essential mineral that is more abundant in meat, poultry and fish. Additionally, the iron in meat and animal-based foods is called heme iron and our bodies can absorb that more easily than the non-heme iron found in plant-based foods. Plant-based sources of iron include soy and tofu, leafy greens, beans, nuts and seeds. Iron is also found in eggs and enriched breads and pasta. When eating plant-based sources of iron, include a good source of vitamin C to increase its absorption.When it comes to vitamin B12 its important to choose fortified plant-based foods like soy milk and cereals. Vitamin B12 is also found in eggs and dairy.",nutrition

are there any guidelines for finding the right macro ratio or foods that work best for me and my metabolism,"by Leesa KlichThe macro ratio (the relative amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fat in your diet) that works best for you may depend on your age, gender and health conditions such as diabetes, as well as other individual factors. There are a few tests that your doctor may order if he she suspects that you may have diabetes or prediabetes. These include the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, A1C test or the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).There are some emerging resources for precision nutrition based on very new research. Results from these non-diagnostic tests should be discussed with your doctor. For example, InsideTracker can help create a personalized action plan to help you reach your health goals. This plan incorporates nutrition, supplement, fitness and lifestyle recommendations based on your blood, DNA and lifestyle habits. Another example of precision nutrition involves microbiome analysis (of the microbes in your gut), which may help you to better manage various gut conditions.",nutrition
how does plantbased food intake change the brain,"Dietary factors can affect multiple brain processes such as cognition, emotion and behavior. They do this by regulating neurotransmitter pathways, synaptic transmission between brain cells, membrane fluidity and signal-transduction pathways. Nutrients that preserve brain health include omega-3 polyunsaturated fats (omega 3-PUFAs) and folic acid.Omega 3-PUFAs regulate several processes within the brain, such as neurotransmission and neuroinflammation. These are key processes in cognition. Foods highest in omega 3-PUFAs include vegetable oils, walnuts and Brazil nuts, as well as poppy, flax and chia seeds. Almonds and olive oil are also relatively high in these fatty acids.Folic acid prevents cognitive decline and dementia during aging and is found in various foods, including leafy green vegetables (e.g. spinach and kale), citrus fruits (e.g. orange juice), whole grains and beans, etc. Foods high in omega 3-PUFAs and folic acid are usually included in whole-food plant-based diets, which focus on plant foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. If animal products are eaten, they should be eaten in smaller quantities compared to plant foods.Importantly, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, as observed in diabetes, are associated with cognitive impairments such as decreased performance on attention and memory tasks. Impaired blood sugar control and insulin resistance could lead to Alzheimers Disease. Thus, it is advised to follow a healthy diet and avoid refined sugars for healthy brain function.More References:Brain foods: the effects of nutrients on brain function.

are there better vegetables and fruits to eat to improve cognitive function or prevent cognitive decline related to aging and disease,"Cognitive function encompasses different mental processes such as attention, working memory, language use, perception, learning, problem solving and decision-making. Cognitive decline associated with normal aging can be attenuated by a wide variety of factors, including improved nutrition through diet. Diet and even nutrient timing can affect neuronal plasticity or the ability of the brain and its cells to change and adapt their structure, function and connections.The brain is highly susceptible to oxidative damage due to its high metabolic load and abundance of oxidizable material (e.g. membranes of neural cells). Antioxidant activity thus plays an important role in the prevention of cognitive disorders.Nutrients with antioxidant activity include B vitamins (including B6, B12 and folate), vitamins C, A, and D, and polyphenols (e.g. resveratrol, flavonoids, etc.). These are all highly present in vegetables and fruits. In fact, a meta-analysis study revealed that increased consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in humans.Examples of vegetables and fruits with high antioxidant content include: sweet potato, carrot, pumpkin, tomato, spinach, kale, cabbage, broccoli, watercress, pepper, cauliflower, strawberry, blueberry, grape, mango, papaya, apricot, kiwi, etc.A great example of a healthy dietary pattern rich in vegetables, fruits and legumes is the Mediterranean diet, which is associated with higher verbal learning and memory performance.More References:Fruit and vegetable intake and cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.

is it true that a ketogenic diet is neuroprotective protects the brain,"The ketogenic diet mimics the physiological alterations observed in prolonged fasting, when the body is maining using body fat or dietary fat for energy. Burning fats for fuel during a ketogenic diet or fasting promotes ketone body production and utilization. The ketogenic diet comprises a high proportion of fat, adequate protein and low carbohydrates.The ketogenic diet has been implemented as a treatment to pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. It also has some beneficial effects on neurology function, such as anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory activity that could be neuroprotective in some brain diseases such as Alzheimers disease.The putative neuroprotective effects of ketone bodies have been associated with a decrease of oxidative damage and the modulation of inflammatory status in the brain. However, the ketogenic diet has common adverse gastrointestinal side effects including vomiting, constipation, diarrhea and hyperlipidemia. Thus a ketogenic diet should only be administered within a limited period of time and under careful clinical supervision of dietitians, even if you are healthy.More References:New insights into the mechanisms of the ketogenic diet.

what other nutrition patterns are neuroprotective,"The Mediterranean diet is associated with better cognitive performance in memory, language and visuospatial perception. It is also associated with lower dementia rates, as shown in a population cohort study. Mediterranean diets typically include the consumption of items such as non-refined cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, potatoes, fish and olive oil. They typically involve avoidance of meat and meat products, poultry and full-fat dairy products.Furthermore, nutritional studies show that caloric restriction or reducing food intake can significantly influence healthy aging, including brain aging. Caloric restriction is the most effective intervention known to date that has the potential to robustly increase the lifespan of several species, from yeast to mammals. Caloric restriction has been shown to improve healthy lifespan in non-human primates, which share a high degree of similarity to humans. According to Dr. David Sinclairs theory, caloric restriction is a moderate stress that produces a highly conserved stress response. This response modifies multiple cell signaling pathways that regulate cell growth (think tapping the brakes on cancer cell growth), metabolism, oxidative stress response, DNA damage repair and inflammation. It causes adaptive responses in cells and organs that prevent further damage from other stresses. This response in the end increases the organisms chance of surviving adversity.Intermittent fasting, a variation of caloric restriction, has also more recently been shown to have beneficial health and brain health effects. These dietary regimens seem to prevent some age-related neuronal damage, preserve learning and memory and may have a significant benefit for debilitating and prevalent neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers, Huntingtons and Parkinsons diseases.More References:Neuroprotective Diets Are Associated with Better Cognitive Function: The Health and Retirement Study.

what nutrition guidelines should i be aware of as a patient or caregiver of a patient with alzheimers disease,"Nutrition intervention in Alzheimers disease aims to effectively enhance food intake and prevent weight loss, poor eating habits, depression, impaired memory and self-feeding difficulty. Moreover, elevated homocysteine levels are associated with higher risk of cognitive impairment and nutrients such as folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 can act as cofactors for the methylation of homocysteine, lowering homocysteine levels.Escott-Stump (2011) gives the following nutrition-related suggestions for patients with Alzheimers disease:Meals should be taken at regular and consistent times each day. Allow sufficient time for eating and avoid distractions (for example, use calming background music).Adequate fluid intake (water, 100% juice, milk, etc.) is essential to avoid dehydration.Include nutrient-dense foods that are high in antioxidants and folic acid (leafy greens, orange juice, broccoli), which may lessen decline of cognitive function. Consume color-rich fruits and vegetables such as blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, spinach, kale, broccoli, oranges, and other citrus fruits.Consume more oily fish (salmon, halibut, trout, and tuna) for omega-3 fatty acids. Cut back on saturated fats, which increase brain beta-amyloid levels, and avoid high-fat dairy products, fast food items, fried foods and processed foods.Since vitamin B12 is not found in any plant foods, prefer vitamin B12 from low-fat red meat and low-fat dairy products.Increase the intake of foods rich in potassium to preserve muscle mass (e.g. fruit and vegetables).Finger foods are easier to eat and help to maintain weight (e.g. sandwiches cut into four, cheese cubes, pancakes or waffles cut in smaller pieces, hard cooked egg halves, chicken strips, julienne vegetables).",nutrition
what nutrition guidelines should i be aware of as a patient or caregiver of a patient with parkinsons disease,"Nutrition intervention in Parkinsons disease aims to supply dopamine to the brain, improve the ability to eat, correct alterations in gastrointestinal function (i.e., increased transit time, heartburn, constipation, and control body weight, which may fluctuate from either reduced mobility or the inability to ingest sufficient energy quantities.Escott-Stump (2011) gives the following nutrition-related suggestions:The timing of levodopa administration should be monitored to avoid conflicting responses to protein at meal times.When sucking or swallowing reflexes are reduced, use semisolid foods rather than fluids. Adequate hydration is essential, especially when thickened liquids are needed. Drooling may be a problem: plan diet and proper consistency of foods according to results of swallowing evaluation (e.g. cut, mince, or soften foods as required).Increase intake of fiber (e.g. add crushed bran to hot cereal or try prune juice).Prefer foods such as vegetable oils, nuts, green tea, coffee, turmeric and antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables.A multivitaminmineral supplement may be beneficial, especially for vitamins C, E, and the B-complex vitamins.When using MAOIs anti-depressive medications, follow the tyramine-restricted diet: avoid aged and fermented meats, sausages and salamis; pickled herring; spoiled or improperly stored meat, poultry and fish with changes in coloration, odor or mold; broad bean pods; sauerkraut; aged cheeses; red wines and all varieties of tap beer and beers that have not been pasteurized; over-the-counter supplements containing tyramine; concentrated yeast extract; soybean products such as soy sauce and tofu.",nutrition
what nutrition guidelines should i be aware of as a patient or caregiver of a patient suffering from brain cancer,"Nutrition intervention in brain cancer aims to counteract side effects of therapy (e.g., radiation, surgery, chemotherapy), avoid constipation and monitor carefully for elevated blood glucose levels that may occur with corticosteroids that are used to control brain edema.Escott-Stump (2011) gives the following nutrition-related suggestions:Regular and attractive meals are important to help poor appetite. Keep in mind that sense of smell may have declined recently. Alter texture and liquids when feeling difficulty or discomfort in swallowing.If oral diet is possible, include fish, fruits, vegetables and adequate fiber. Include green tea, food sources of beta-carotene and fish oil to enhance neuroprotection.Limit salt intake (maximum 46 g day) to correct cerebral edema.Ketogenic diets may represent potentially viable treatments to limit oncogenesis because cancer cells preferentially use glucose for energy, and the ketogenic diet provides ketone bodies for energy to the brain.

are there any foods i should avoid if i suffer from migraines,"To date, there is no strong scientific evidence to support any particular migraine diet. Some lifestyle triggers appear to be common across migraine patients (caffeine, alcohol, skipping meals), whereas some foods or food components are reported to increase the likelihood of a migraine attack in susceptible individuals. However, these food triggers appear to be highly individualized. Thus, priority should be given to monitor the most common triggers observed before your migraine attacks.Evidence does not support elimination diets to identify triggers for migraine prevention. Moreover, migraine sufferers often note that missing meals can trigger headache, so is important to make time for small frequent meals. Migraine attacks are often due to multiple factors and there are many non-dietary trigger factors. For example, when youre already not sleeping well, not exercising or going through the let-down effect of a stressful period, skipping a meal may make it more likely to have a migraine attack. Therefore, it is the combination of all of these different things that contribute to the migraine, and not just one factor. Try to engage in a healthy lifestyle with regular daily meal times, in addition to maintaining a regular sleep schedule.References:American Migraine Foundation, Vol. 2018.Pathophysiology of Migraine: A Disorder of Sensory Processing.

are there any general guidelines for fruit and vegetable intake and contraindications with common drugs  supplements,"Some foods or beverages can interact with certain drug medications. For example, some foods drinks can lower the levels of enzymes in your liver responsible for breaking down medications, causing blood levels of an interacting drug to rise, potentially leading to toxicity. On the other hand, alcohol should be avoided because it can add to the side effects of various medications.Moreover, there is meal-drug interaction as drug absorption will depend on meal timing: some medications should not be taken on an empty stomach due to stomach discomfort (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs); whereas some medicines work better when you take them on an empty stomach (e.g. sleep medicines should not be taken with a meal or right after a meal).Other recommendations to prevent drug-food interactions include:Avoid grapefruit juice while using statins to lower cholesterol, like atorvastatin, lovastatin or simvastatin. The result can be muscle pain or even severe muscle injury known as rhabdomyolysis.Avoid cranberry juice or cranberry products while using anticoagulants because they can change the effects of warfarin.Avoid consuming dairy products (like milk and yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone while using ciprofloxacin antibiotics. However, you can take ciprofloxacin with a meal that has these products in it. The presence of antacids, such as calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate, could modify antibiotic dissolution rate and reduce its absorption, leading to therapeutic failure.Oral chemo-therapeutics used in cancer therapy might interact with high-fat meals, calcium-containing foods supplements and with grapefruit. Oral chemotherapeutics have a fairly narrow therapeutic index and potential drug interactions can cause significant changes in total absorption of these medications.Avoid foods and drinks that contain tyramine while using anti-depressant monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or oxazolidinone antibiotics. High levels of tyramine can cause a sudden, dangerous increase in your blood pressure. Tyramine is present in cheeses, especially strong, aged, or processed cheese; aged, pickled, fermented or smoked foods.References:Food-Drug Interactions: a guide from the National Consumers League and U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

how does the brain help regulate food intake,"Humans and animals start secreting metabolic hormones in anticipation of a pending meal. This response can also occur through stimuli or cues that reliably predict food availability. Stimuli such as the smell and sight of food, time of day, circadian time, time elapsed since the previous meal and specific environments where meals have occurred in the past can all trigger responses in the brain.Based on food-related stimuli and cues, the brain sends signals to secretory organs before you even ingest your food. Several hormones are secreted in order to increase sensitivity to taste and smell and the gastrointestinal tract becomes primed to digest a meal. These hormones include glucagon-like peptide 1 (peaks around 1 hour before a meal), ghrelin (peaks around 30 minutes before) and insulin (10 to 15 minutes before). Other meal-related responses are also activated before eating actually begins, including salivation, thermogenesis, secretion of gastric acid and increased gastrointestinal motility.Once food is in your mouth, there is contact between the food and sensory receptors that transmit information about the quantity and nutrient composition of the meal. During this phase, orosensory stimuli arising from palatable food (e.g., sweet and fat taste) provide positive feedback to the brain that increases the rate and amount of food consumption during a single meal. Interestingly, a food that is highly palatable at the beginning of a meal becomes progressively less palatable* by the end of a meal when satiation is attained.*If you eat a large piece of cake very slowly, you might notice this happening! This attentiveness to how your food tastes as you eat is known as intuitive or mindful eating.On the contrary, a bitterness taste suggests that a food or food component might be poisonous or toxic and our brain is primed to differentiate this in order to keep us healthy.Information related to ingested food is transmitted from the stomach and small intestine to the brain via the vagal nerve. More specifically, the vagal nerve detects the stretch of the gut wall and signals such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide YY and serotonin released by gut enteroendocrine cells in response to nutrients. The vagal nerve then activates neurons in a specific brain area, the nucleus tractus solitarius, promoting satiation and meal termination. All of this happens relatively quickly during and after a meal.In contrast, long-term feedback that suppresses hunger arises from your energy stores and is transmitted by a hormone called leptin. This hormone is produced by adipocytes, thus circulates in proportion to fat stores. Leptin primarily signals neurons in another brain structure, the hypothalamus, to indicate whether fat stores are adequate in order to decrease food intake.More References:Toward a Wiring Diagram Understanding of Appetite Control.

what is a food craving from the perspective of the brain how can i or should i tune into my food cravings,"The motivational wanting to eat, i.e., food craving, can be triggered by external cues, hunger states or simply imagining the sight, smell and taste of palatable foods. Food cues in the surrounding environment activate the brain reward system. This reward system preferentially engages our attention towards calorie dense foods. This happens especially when we are hungry, increasing our motivation to eat (i.e. food craving). More specifically, if we pay attention to food cues surrounding us in our daily life (e.g., the appetitive smell of a freshly baked chocolate cake or if we see golden crispy french fries or a delicious melted cheese pizza), the brain is triggered to search for calorie dense foods. And this triggering is augmented when we are hungry.Therefore, on a daily basis, try to have a healthy balanced diet and avoid obesogenic environments or environments that encourage you to eat unhealthy and that have the potential to induce food cravings and overconsumption. For example, avoid strolling around pastries, supermarket shopping when you are hungry or walking by takeaway outlets in shopping areas.Whenever you experience food cravings, try not to immediately give in to the urge to consume the food, but rather focus on and accept the bodily sensations and thoughts that accompany this urge, a mindfulness-based technique used by Alberts et. al (2010). By using this exercise, the primary aim of this approach is not to limit food intake, but to increase awareness of the automatic pattern that usually emerges in case of food cravings, Alberts et. al (2010) explains.More References:Food and addiction: a comprehensive handbook.

FNIC'sNutrient Lists from Standard Reference Legacy (2018)provide lists of which foods have the most and least content of specific nutrients.For additional resources, see ourWhat's in Foodsection.",nutrition
what is the difference between calories and kilocalories,"The ""calorie"" we refer to in food is actually kilocalorie. One (1) kilocalorie is the same as one (1) Calorie (upper case C). A kilocalorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water one degree Celsius. Please visitUSDA's Food Composition Laboratoryfor additional information.",nutrition
where can i find a printable list of foods that are high or low in different nutrients such as sodium potassium phosphorus and protein,"USDA'sFoodData Central offers a Component Search, which creates a list of food sources for a selected component or nutrient. For example, by selecting the component potassium, FoodData Central generates a list of foods that contain potassium. The list can be sorted in different ways by clicking on the results column headers. It can also be downloaded as a CSV spreadsheet for printing by clicking on the Download Results button.Other sources of printable nutrient lists include the Food and Nutrition Information Centers Nutrient Lists from Standard Reference Legacy (2018)and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans Food Sources of Select Nutrients.",nutrition
is there a law that requires food labels to list ingredients that commonly cause food allergies,"TheFood Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, which went into effect January, 2006, requires that food labels identify in plain English if the product contains any of the eight major food allergens - milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat and soybeans.",nutrition
what are the sources of vitamin d and b12,"The main source of vitamin D is from the action of sunlight on the skin. However, if you live at Northern latitudes such as Ireland, UVB rays are only sufficiently strong to make vitamin D from about April to September. During this time, about 15-20 min exposure to sunlight, on arms a few times a week is sufficient for vitamin D-making. Food sources are few, but include oily fish, egg yolk and fortified foods (e.g. some milks and cereals).Vitamin B12 is required for red blood cell formation and a healthy nervous system. The vitamin is present in a variety of foods, but mainly meat, fish, eggs and dairy products and some fortified products (e.g. milk, soya milks, cereals). Those who do not consume animal products may be at risk of deficiency (vegan diets) or those with poor or low dietary intake, which may include older adults. The area of B12 is a highly active area of research, particularly how this vitamin may be involved in brain health and cognition.",nutrition
is organic produce healthier than its nonorganic counterparts,"Organic food is the product of an agricultural or aqua-cultural system of farming that places a strong emphasis on environmental protection and animal welfare. While organic and non-organically produced food may appear very similar, the systems of farming involved in their production can be very different. The term organic means different things to different people. For some, it means produce that is healthier, or more nutritious. For others, it could signify eco-friendly, or even tastier. It brings with it connotations of clean, good, or even more expensive foods.The question of whether organic food is different to non-organic food with respect to nutritional content or quality is still a matter of furious public and scientific debate. While the farming systems used can differ substantially, organically grown food is nutritionally identical to conventional food and there is no definitive data to date that has reported distinguishable differences between the end-products of organic farming and their non-organically produced counterparts  in terms of taste or nutritional content. Moreover, there is no recognised scientific test that exclusively differentiates between the nutrient content of organic and non-organic produce.",nutrition
how much water should i be drinking daily,"Regular drinks are necessary to replace fluid lost during the day. Water is a major constituent of the body and has many functions including transporting nutrients and compounds in blood, removing waste-products that are then passed in urine. Water regulates the bodys temperature and without enough water, people can quickly become dehydrated. When dehydrated, the first thing you will notice is increased thirst and a dry, sticky mouth. Other side effects can include tiredness, poor concentration, headaches and even dizziness or light headedness. Drinking enough is vital to maintain good health in the short and long term, for example, for the prevention of constipation, kidney stones and urinary tract infections. Good hydration can also prevent other conditions, such as chronic renal disease.It sounds complicated, but paying attention to your bodys natural cues, including thirst and urination frequency and colour, is a simple and effective place to start. When you drink fluids, you stop you feeling thirsty before you are completely rehydrated. Older people, in particular, need to be careful to drink enough as in many, the sense of thirst decreases with age. Therefore keeping an eye on the colour of your urine is truly the best indicator of hydration; if you are drinking enough water your urine should be a straw or pale yellow colour.Generally speaking, most dietary guidelines recommend adult women and men take on between 1600ml-2000ml per day, or 8-10 cups of water (1 cup = 200ml) per day. This is about right. Drinking at regular intervals throughout the day is the best way to ensure you stay hydrated. As stated above, your urine is the best indicator of your personal hydration status. Keep an eye on the colour of your urine; if it is dark, you need to drink more water.",nutrition
do i need to take vitamin and mineral supplements,"Most recommendations, agree that adults do not need to take vitamin and mineral supplements, or multivitamin products (unless specifically indicated on an individual basis by a health professional); The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), for example, are very strong on their message on this for cancer prevention  the advice is not new, and perhaps may sound mundane, but eat food not supplements and aim to get your vitamin and minerals through a varied healthy diet. ",nutrition
do i need to take vitamins for bone health or for osteoporosis,"One area of concern is maintaining bone health through adulthood, and both physical activity and adequate vitamin D and calcium are important here. Adults, in Ireland for example, would tend to be prescribed a vitamin D and calcium supplement if osteoporosis is detected or earlier signs of osteoporosis were noted. Some recommendations on vitamin D vary, in Ireland a low dose supplement of vitamin D is actually recommended (10g per day for people aged 51 years and over)  Ireland and other northern countries dont get enough sunlight to make vitamin D especially from November to MarchApril. We are actually studying much higher doses of vitamin D 3 in adults aged 65+, to see if it may be associated with better brain health and muscle function, but that is still very much really at a research level, and cannot yet recommend these higher doses.",nutrition
what are good sources of protein,"Eggs are a high-quality source of protein. They are soft and can be prepared many ways. There is cholesterol in eggs, but this cholesterol is not going to affect a persons overall cholesterol as much as saturated fats and trans fats. Nuts are another good source of protein, but if a person has a chewing problem, you can incorporate nut butters into recipes instead. Fish, chicken and meat are excellent protein sources, and soy protein can sometimes be helpful for people who are willing to try it.",nutrition
what are good and bad foods,"If youre looking at improving true functional health, there really are no good or bad foods. Unless a person truly has to avoid some foods because of allergens or medical restrictions, I do not discourage certain foods. Its always good to allow yourself to be realistic, and so much of nutrition is about moderation. Nutrition is like a marathon  you are always working at it.",nutrition
how can fluids be added to a diet,"For seniors, always have a beverage at their side  all fluids count. Also provide foods with a high water content such as soups, smoothies, popsicles, and fruits like melons and grapes. Many fruits and vegetables contain 90 percent or more water. In winter, seniors can drink hot fluids like cocoa, coffee and tea. Having a caregiver present encouraging the senior to get enough liquids can make a big difference.",nutrition
 what about sugarfree or diet foods,"I advise steering away from processed, diet foods because they have a number of chemical additives. Some artificial sweeteners can cause intestinal cramping. Seniors rely on some processed foods like frozen dinners, but it is really important for their diet to include more of plain, fresh, unprocessed foods.",nutrition
how can fiber be added to a seniors diet,"The best way for seniors to get fiber is through plant-based foods and cereals. Some cereals are also fortified with iron and zinc. Seniors should eat whole grains as much as possible. If its hard to get fiber through these foods, there are fiber supplements, and even fiber Gummies are now available. Adding ground flaxseeds or oatmeal to foods helps with fiber.For foods richer in fiber, look for foods labeled with 5 grams or more of fiber per serving. When increasing fiber in a seniors diet, always do so slowly with an increase in fluids to prevent abdominal distress.",nutrition
how important is vitamin d,"The recommended vitamin D levels are usually not enough to boost people to a healthy level. Everyone should be taking a vitamin D supplement. Many of the multivitamins are starting to include more vitamin D. It is best to talk with a doctor about the amount of vitamin D a senior can safely add to their diet. Good vitamin D food sources include fish, eggs and fortified milk; however, you cannot get enough vitamin D in your diet alone.",nutrition
what about medication and food interactions,"Always check with your doctor and pharmacist about how a specific medication interacts with food. For example, some leafy greens and foods high in vitamin K can affect blood thinners. If you are taking a blood thinner, you dont need to avoid leafy green vegetables entirely  you just need to be consistent in your intake and not go overboard. Also, grapefruit can affect the absorption and metabolizing of certain drugs. Salt substitutes often replace salt with potassium and can decrease the effectiveness of medications for high blood pressure and congestive heart failure.",nutrition
what kind of fat is ok to eat,"Fish, nuts and avocadoes are a healthier source of monounsaturated fats. You want to go lighter on the saturated fats in meats. Trans fats found in processed foods and fried foods are considered more harmful. Dairy has saturated fat in it, but I dont tell people to avoid milk fat. I recommend being moderate with animal-based fats such as cheese.",nutrition
what helps with a poor appetite,"When seniors are dealing with appetite issues caused by cancer treatments or surgery recovery, or just not wanting to eat, you may want to mix up the diet a bit. Some of the nutritional supplements such as Ensure can be a benefit, but you dont want to solely depend on them. You might want to add in some fruit, protein powder or ice cream. Caregivers can help with adding nutritional variety to a diet.",nutrition
how do you deal with unintentional weight loss,"Calorie intake is an individual measure for each person, but if an elderly person loses 5 percent of his or her body weight in a month, that is significant. That fluctuation is a red flag and should be addressed by a doctor. With this type of unplanned weight loss, the person is at higher risk for getting sick and not healing well. There could be something else going on in the body. Weight monitoring is important for older loved ones, especially those with medical conditions such as congestive heart failure. Also, if you notice your loved one is gaining weight rapidly, this could be a sign of an underlying health condition.",nutrition
 are fresh vegetables better than frozen,"The nutritional differences between fresh, frozen and canned vegetables is minuscule. Only 9% of Americans get enough vegetables daily, so its much more important to consume any vegetables, in any state. Vegetables are filled with vitamins, minerals and fiber, which help reduce the risk of developing heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. The best advice is to buy whatever vegetables you can source and afford, and then prepare them in ways you enjoy most.",nutrition
do i have to drink milk to get calcium,"Dairy products such as milk, cheese and yogurt are a great source of calcium, with about 250 to 350 milligrams per serving. (Adults require 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams of calcium per day, depending on age and gender.) Dairy products are certainly an easy and convenient way to get enough calcium, but theyre not the only way. Fortified plant-based beverages (such as those made from almonds, oats, cashews, etc.) also have 300 milligrams of calcium per cup, as does a serving of canned salmon or sardines, as long as you eat the bones. Foods such as kale, almonds, white beans and tofu have about 100 milligrams of calcium per serving, and broccoli clocks in at 40 milligrams per cup. The bottom line: Milk is not essential, but calcium is. With some mindful planning, you can get enough calcium whether your diet includes dairy or not.",nutrition
should i avoid fruit because it has too much sugar,"The No. 1 source of added sugar for Americans, providing 47% of the sugar in their diet, is sweetened beverages  items such as soda, lemonade, fruit punch and energy drinks. Fruit provides 1% of the added sugars Americans consume. (Note: Health advice to limit added sugar does not apply to the natural sugar in fruit.) Even if Americans met their daily fruit intake  and 88% do not  it wouldnt come close to the volume of sugar we get from ultra-processed foods and beverages. If you need to cut back on sugar, swap sweetened beverages for water. Keep enjoying fruit, and aim for one or two cups per day.",nutrition
do i need to drink eight glasses of water daily,"Drinking water is vital because we lose fluid every day through sweating, urinating and breathing. But how can it be possible that each one of us  regardless of age, gender, size, activity level and diet  requires eight glasses per day? The answer: Its not. That number comes from a 1945 U.S. Food and Nutrition Board recommendation, which was not based on research. And it didnt recommend drinking only water for hydration; it noted that fluid can come from other beverages and food, too. So, theres no scientific basis for the eight glasses number. In most cases, thirst is your best indicator that you need a drink. If that sense is compromised, keep beverages visible so you remember to sip throughout the day. Exactly how much to drink is not a static number for everyone.",nutrition
is sugar the biggest problem in our diets,"No single nutrient or ingredient is the cause of poor diets. We live in an environment where highly palatable and cheap food is available everywhere. Pizza, chips, pastries and soda are dietary staples, and the average American gets almost 60% of their daily calories from such ultra-processed foods. Whats most problematic is eating too much of those ultra-processed foods and not enough whole foods (such as vegetables, fish and nuts) over a long period of time.",nutrition
 what should my blood sugar be when i wake up fasting and before meals what about after," For most people with diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting or before-meals blood glucose (or blood sugar) goal of 70130 mg dl. One to two hours after eating, a postprandial blood sugar reading at or under 180 mg dl is recommended.",diabetes
 does a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mean i will have to go on insulin," No. People with type 2 diabetes may or may not ever need to take insulin injections, depending on several factors, including the timing of diagnosis. Research indicates that if type 2 diabetes is treated early and blood sugar is controlled initially and over the years, the pancreas is more likely to produce enough insulin longer. But a person who lives with type 2 upward of 15 years is unlikely to continue to make sufficient insulin and will need to take it via syringe, pen, or pump.",diabetes
 i was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes do i need to see an endocrinologist," ""While diabetes is an endocrine disease and falls under the specialty of an endocrinologist, there are only 3,000 of us in the U.S. who treat diabetes,"" says Nicholas Argento, M.D., an endocrinologist with Maryland Endocrine near Baltimore who has type 1 diabetes. Do the math: 25 million people have diabetes; there are not nearly enough endocrinologists. ""Most people with type 2 diabetes, especially in the early years, can partner with a primary care provider who takes an active interest in their diabetes,"" Argento says. Make sure your doctor keeps up-to-date and provides you with care in sync with current guidelines. Be active in your care and ask questions.",diabetes
 can i get rid of type 2 diabetes if i stop eating carbs andor lose a lot of weight," No, but you can control it. If you have prediabetes or were just diagnosed with type 2, losing a lot of weight can put the condition into remission. Weight regain, aging, and the natural progression of type 2 diabetes can bring it back. ""Not eating carbohydrate or severely restricting it is nearly impossible for any length of time. It's also not healthy, because you won't get essential nutrients,"" says JoJo Dantone, RD, CDE, a diabetes program coordinator in New Orleans.",diabetes
 why is it ok to eat fruit when its full of carbohydrate are some fruits better to eat than others," The calories in all fruits (fresh, frozen, dried, and canned without added sugar) are mainly carbohydrate with a bit of protein. People with diabetes need to eat a certain amount of carbs every day for energy and essential nutrients. Healthy sources of carbs include fruits, as well as vegetables, whole grains, legumes (beans), and low-fat dairy foods.",diabetes
 why do my legs hurt when i start walking and stop hurting when i sit down," You have signs of peripheral arterial disease, or PAD. ""It develops when too much plaque in your arteries limits blood flow to the legs. The pain may occur while you walk because muscles need increased blood flow. The pain may stop when you sit because your muscles then require less blood flow,"" says Marjorie Cypress, Ph.D., CNP, CDE, a nurse practitioner in Albuquerque and president of Health Care and Education for the American Diabetes Association. PAD increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and foot ulcers. Cypress suggests lowering your risks for PAD with the same advice you follow to stay healthy with diabetes.",diabetes
 how can i learn to accept my diabetes," Accepting that you have diabetes is largely an act of cognition-a realignment of what you view as real and vital to your existence and how it can impact your life. Diabetes becomes an integral part of a person's life. ""While we all wish it would simply go away, this isn't possible-yet,"" says David Marrero, Ph.D., who has diabetes and is the director of the Diabetes Translational Research Center at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Marrero's advice: Accept that diabetes will, for the rest of your life, be there. And it's a very treatable disease, which places few restrictions on you if you follow treatment recommendations.",diabetes
 my husband has type 2 diabetes and is a truck driver what foods can he take on the road," ""Preplanning and having healthy snacks at the ready are keys to helping you eat healthy on the road,"" says Lisa Brown, RD, CDE, of BrownFox Solutions in Minneapolis and chair of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Diabetes Care and Education practice group. Brown suggests fresh fruit, small containers or cans of fruit (no syrup), fat-free yogurt, part-skim cheese (sticks, slices, and cubes), sugar-free pudding cups, nuts (any type), whole wheat crackers or pretzels, peanut butter, baby carrots, and 100-calorie snack packs (buy them or create your own). Also, drink plenty of water and no-calorie drinks.",diabetes
 will insulin make me gain weight," The reason we need insulin-as a hormone made in our bodies or as a medication-is to push glucose into cells for energy. Insulin's job is to process calories. For this reason, it can-but doesn't have to-cause weight gain. To prevent weight gain: Practice portion control. Burn extra calories with exercise. If your blood sugar has been high for a while prior to starting insulin, you've likely been excreting calories in your urine instead of fueling your body. This won't happen once your blood sugar is under control. If you experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), treat it with just 15 grams of carb.",diabetes
 why is weight loss so important whats the best way for a person with type 2 to lose weight," Weight loss is vital, particularly just after a diagnosis of type 2 or prediabetes. Weight loss increases insulin sensitivity, allowing cells to more effectively use the insulin the body continues to make. Losing just 1020 pounds can accomplish a boatload of benefits. Among them are improved blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels and possibly taking fewer medications or lower doses. To lose weight slowly and steadily, change your lifestyle. The pounds you keep off over time are the most important to living a long life.",diabetes
 can i drink alcohol," Yes, adults with diabetes can drink alcohol and should follow the same guidelines as the general public-an average of up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men, with no more than three or four drinks in any single day for women and men, respectively. ""Research shows moderate alcohol consumption has minimal short- or long-term effects on glucose levels in people with type 1 or 2 diabetes,"" says Marion Franz, RD, CDE, owner of Nutrition Concepts by Franz in Minneapolis.",diabetes
 can your menstrual cycle andor going through menopause affect glucose levels," Foods that contain carbohydrate are quick and easy to digest for energy. ""Eat foods like bread, crackers, pretzels, dry cereal, 100 percent fruit juice, or sports drink with calories,"" says Gary Scheiner, CDE, an exercise physiologist and owner of Integrated Diabetes Services near Philadelphia. But if weight loss is a goal and you aren't at risk of hypoglycemia, just drink water-ditto for after exercise. Unless your workout was particularly exhausting or lasted several hours, you don't need food. People who take insulin and are physically active should consult their health care provider about how to adjust insulin dosages.",diabetes
 what are the best foods to eat before and after exercising," ""The CDC strongly recommends that blood-testing devices, including lancets, should never be used by more than one person to prevent any chance of infection,"" says Connie Crawley, RD, nutrition and health specialist at the University of Georgia Extension Service in Athens. ""And alcohol may not sufficiently disinfect a lancet.""",diabetes
 why cant my wife and i use the same lancet if we clean it," Once you are diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you have it for the rest of your life. To stay healthy, keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol under good control. To do so, eat healthy, be physically active, and take your prescribed medications. Also get the tests and checks you need to detect complications early and treat them aggressively.",diabetes
 can i get rid of diabetes will it ever go away," The only reason to replace your meter is if you determine it is not working correctly with its strips. To check, use the control solution that comes with your meter. ""It's an essential monitoring supply that many people don't know about or use,"" says Janine Freeman, RDN, CDE, a member of the American Association of Diabetes Educators Board of Directors.",diabetes
 how often should i replace my glucose meter," Your risk for hypoglycemia depends on the category of blood glucose-lowering medication(s) you take, not your type of diabetes. Some medications can cause hypoglycemia, including insulin; those in the sulfonylurea category, such as glyburide (Diabeta, Glynase, Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glimepiride (Amaryl); and those in the glinide category, such as repaglinide (Prandin) and nateglinide (Starlix). If you take one of these medications, always carry treatment. Most of the commonly used blood glucose-lowering medications for type 2 diabetes don't cause hypoglycemia.",diabetes
 should i always carry glucose tablets," Yes! Research shows that the earlier your diabetes is diagnosed and the sooner you start to aggressively get your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol into target ranges, the healthier you can be over the years. To stay healthy and detect any complications early, make sure your health care provider orders all the tests and checks you need. Let your provider know if you have any signs or symptoms of a potential problem. Today, diabetes complications don't need to happen.",diabetes
 is it true that complications of diabetes can be delayed and even prevented," If you have type 2 diabetes and were put on insulin, it's likely you need it to bring your blood sugar down farther than pills could. In this case, you'll likely need to take insulin injections the rest of your life. If, however, you started taking insulin when you had an infection, needed surgery, or were hospitalized for a medical reason, your need for insulin may be temporary. These situations raise stress, and stress can raise blood sugar levels. When the stress abates, you may be able to taper or stop taking insulin and get back to your previous medication regimen.",diabetes

If, however, you started taking insulin when you had an infection, needed surgery, or were hospitalized for a medical reason, your need for insulin may be temporary. These situations raise stress, and stress can raise blood sugar levels. When the stress abates, you may be able to taper or stop taking insulin and get back to your previous medication regimen.",diabetes

what causes high blood sugar,"Many things can cause high blood sugar, but what we eat plays the biggest and most direct role in elevating blood sugar. When we eat carbohydrates, our body converts those carbohydrates into glucose, and this can play a role in raising blood sugar. Protein, to a certain degree, in high amounts can also raise blood sugar levels. Fat does not raise blood sugar levels. Stress leading to an increase in the hormone cortisol can also raise blood sugar levels.Learn more in Dr. Sarah Hallberg's video on how what we eat impacts our blood sugar.",diabetes
whats the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes,By Dr. Priyanka WaliType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that results in the bodys inability to produce insulin. People who suffer from Type 1 diabetes must be on insulin in order to keep glucose levels within normal limits.Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which either the body is able to produce insulin but is not able to produce enough or the body does not respond to the insulin that is being produced (known as insulin resistance). People with type 2 diabetes must be on a low carbohydrate diet to keep their diabetes from worsening.Learn more in Dr. Sarah Hallberg's guide to reversing diabetes.,diabetes
what should your fasting blood sugar be,"By Dr. Priyanka WaliA fasting blood sugar should be less than 100 in order to be considered normal.A fasting blood sugar of >100 to 125 is consistent with prediabetes.Fasting blood sugar levels of 126 or greater is diagnostic of diabetes.If your fasting blood glucose is consistent with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, we recommend that you speak with your physician.Learn more about how food impacts your fasting blood glucose.",diabetes
what is diabetic ketoacidosis,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (or DKA) is a serious medical condition that can result from very high levels of ketones in the blood. If it is not recognized and treated right away, then it can lead to a coma or even death. Because it is such a serious condition, a person who develops diabetic ketoacidosis is usually admitted to the hospital for treatment.This condition occurs when the bodys cells are unable to use glucose for energy, and the body begins to break down fat for energy instead. Ketones are produced when the body breaks down fat, and very high levels of ketones can make the blood extremely acidic. The acidity can potentially cause coma and death.People with type 1 diabetes are at risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis if they do not take their insulin, if they do not eat, or if they become sick for other reasons (such as an infection). It is very unusual for people with type 2 diabetes to develop diabetic ketoacidosis.Ketoacidosis is different from ketosis. Learn more here: ketosis vs. ketoacidosis.",diabetes
how does metformin treat prediabetes and type 2 diabetes,"By Dr. Jeff StanleyMetformin was first synthesized in the 1920s, but actually wasnt approved for use for type 2 diabetes in the United States until 1995, under the brand name Glucophage. Metformin is also used for the treatment of prediabetes and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), although it is not currently FDA approved for this use.Interestingly, the mechanism of action of metformin is not fully understood. It appears to reduce glucose production in the liver, although there is now evidence that other factors may also play a role. Metformin is generally safe and well-tolerated by patients and does not tend to cause low blood glucose, so it is recommended as the first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes.Learn more about the dietary changes required to reverse diabetes without increasing medication in Reversing Diabetes 101 by Dr. Sarah Hallberg.Citations:Metformin for Prediabetes.

what is type 1 diabetes,"By Dr. Priyanka WaliType 1 diabetes is a condition where the body does not produce insulin.What is insulin? Insulin is a hormone that is needed for the body to move glucose from the blood into the bodys cells. All of the organs in the body, including the brain, the heart, and the lungs, are made of cells. These cells use glucose for energy, which is why it is important for the glucose to move from the bloodstream into the cells.The lack of insulin production in type 1 diabetes is usually caused by a problem with the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes is considered to be a permanent condition when it is diagnosed.",diabetes
what are the signs and symptoms of prediabetes,"Prediabetes is considered to be one of the most insidious precursors to diabetes because it may not have any signs or symptoms. This is why it is so important to do diagnostic blood tests checking a fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test to establish a diagnosis of prediabetes. Many people who have prediabetes (which affects 84 million adults in the U.S.) do not have any symptoms. By the time symptoms occurs, the diagnosis has usually already progressed to diabetes. There are some rare situations in which an individual can present with diabetes-related complications such as a retinal bleed, neuropathy or even a stroke, while only having a diagnosis of prediabetes.",diabetes
what is the best diet for prediabetes,"A low carbohydrate diet is the ideal diet for prediabetes. This is because prediabetes occurs when glucose levels start to rise and the body produces insulin to try and lower the glucose levels. If the body cannot produce enough insulin or if the insulin level that the body is producing is not enough to meet the demands of the high glucose load, then glucose levels continue to rise.A low carbohydrate diet can lower blood glucose levels and maintain a low blood glucose level.Learn more in Reversing Diabetes 101 by Dr. Sarah Hallberg.",diabetes
how do you reverse prediabetes,"Prediabetes can be reversed by following a low carbohydrate diet.Once glucose levels are lowered with a low carbohydrate diet, the bodys demand for insulin also goes down. As insulin levels are lowered due to lowered glucose levels, this will then be reflected in lab results such as a normal HbA1c or fasting glucose. Once HbA1c or fasting glucose has been normalized, then one can say that the prediabetes has been put into remission or reversed.Learn more in Reversing Diabetes 101 by Dr. Sarah Hallberg.Dr. Hallberg describes how a low carbohydrate diet can be an effective treatment for insulin resistance in this video.",diabetes
what is the usual treatment for prediabetes,"Some providers may prescribe Metformin to patients who suffer from prediabetes for some time and are unable to make the dietary changes to reverse their prediabetes, yet are at high risk for developing diabetes.Many patients who receive a diagnosis of prediabetes will also be told to lose weight with diet and exercise. Weight loss also plays a role in reversing prediabetes; however, the mechanism by which prediabetes is reversed is related to lowering insulin levels, and lowering insulin levels can help reduce weight.Prediabetes can be treated with a low carbohydrate diet.

what causes type 2 diabetes,"By Dr. Austin SmithGenes and environment can play a role in causing type 2 diabetes mellitus.Lets first take a step back. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes less responsive to insulin, which is the hormone responsible for shuttling glucose (sugar) from the blood into various tissues throughout the body. Ordinarily, the bodys tissues are made up of cells that contain receptors that bind to insulin. These receptors allow insulin, and the glucose thats bound to it, to enter the cell. If insulin struggles to bind to these receptors effectively, then glucose ends up remaining in the bloodstream, where cells are unable to use it for fuel. This is known as insulin resistance.Eventually, the pancreas, which is the organ responsible for producing insulin, can burn out and the amount of insulin it can produce decreases. This is known as relative insulin deficiency.Both insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency can become severe enough to cause type 2 diabetes.And the causes for both insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency can be traced to ones genes or environmental influences.Rarely is it the case that just one gene is responsible for causing type 2 diabetes. More often, multiple genes play a role. These genes are involved in multiple processes throughout the body, including the development of the pancreas and the release of insulin.Two of the most important environmental influences associated with type 2 diabetes are weight gain (although there are also genetic influences on weight) and decreased physical activity. Insulin resistance can be linked to obesity, and improved with weight loss. Exercise, too, can help improve insulin resistance.Ultimately, if type 2 diabetes develops--be it from insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency, or both--ones ability to tolerate carbohydrates in the diet drops off significantly. For many, carbohydrates in the diet make up the majority of the bodys supply of glucose. And so if insulin isnt being produced in normal amounts (relative insulin deficiency) or if insulin cant bind to its receptors and shuttle glucose into the cells effectively (insulin resistance), then the glucose produced by the breakdown of carbohydrates will end up remaining in the bloodstream, where it can damage various organs.Learn more about reversing diabetes through nutrition.Citations:Jameson, J.

how do i know if i have diabetes,"By Dr. Jeff StanleyType 2 diabetes is diagnosed in a number of ways. These include a fasting glucose of > or = 126 mg dL, a hemoglobin a1c of 6.5% or greater, or elevated glucose on an oral glucose tolerance test. In addition, a random glucose of >200 is suggestive of diabetes.However, there are a number of signs and symptoms that suggest type 2 diabetes and should make you consider getting a blood test. These include excessive thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, numbness or tingling of extremities, weight gain and fatigue. Other possible symptoms include erectile dysfunction in men and irregular periods in women.Learn more about the dietary changes required to reverse diabetes without increasing medication in Reversing Diabetes 101 by Dr. Sarah Hallberg.Citation:Bays HE, Bazata DD, Clark NG, et al.

what are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes,"Symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus are as varied as they are unpleasant. If you notice any of the symptoms mentioned in this post, it would be advisable to seek medical attention.For example, one might notice an increase in urination. A hallmark feature of type 2 diabetes is an elevated glucose (sugar) level in the blood. When blood glucose levels are high, the kidney struggles to filter the excess glucose out of the urine. The urine thus contains more glucose than it should, and this leads to higher volumes of fluid leaving the body through the urine. This is often accompanied by an increase in thirst. Sometimes the fluid losses from the urine are so great that it can lead to weight loss. To be clear, developing type 2 diabetes as a way to lose weight is dangerous, ill-advised, and should never be pursued.Additionally, type 2 diabetes makes it difficult for the bodys organs to receive dietary fuel in the form of glucose. And when the bodys organs arent getting the energy they need to perform as they should, this can lead to fatigue and hunger.Type 2 diabetes also makes it harder for the body to heal. This can lead to more frequent infections and slow-healing wounds.Elevated blood glucose levels from type 2 diabetes can lead to blurry vision. Vision can improve as blood glucose levels decrease.As if all the above werent enough, sometimes type 2 diabetes can lead to very severe dehydration and a significant impairment of ones ability to think and speak clearly. And yes, while any of the above symptoms warrant seeking medical attention, these particularly worrisome symptoms warrant seeking medical attention immediately.Learn more about reversing diabetes through nutrition.",diabetes
what are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes in women,"In general, men and women have similar symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These include excessive thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, numbness or tingling of extremities, weight gain and fatigue. However, there are some additional symptoms in women that may signal possible type 2 diabetes. These include frequent vaginal yeast infections or urinary tract infections. High blood glucose levels make infections more common and difficult to treat. While there are obviously many possible cause for these infections, patients experiencing recurrent or severe infections should consider evaluation for diabetes.Another frequent issue seen in women with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). This syndrome is thought to be connected to insulin resistance, a key component of diabetes, and common symptoms of PCOS include irregular menstrual periods, acne, pelvic pain, and infertility.In addition, it is important to note that women with a history of gestational diabetes during pregnancy have an increased chance of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. If you have a history of gestational diabetes and have any of the symptoms listed here, it is a good idea to have a blood test for diabetes.Citation:Bays HE, Bazata DD, Clark NG, et al.

what are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes in men,"In general, men and women have similar symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These include excessive thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, numbness or tingling of extremities, weight gain and fatigue.In addition to these commonly discussed symptoms, another issue discussed less frequently is erectile dysfunction. In fact, a study showed a three-fold increase in erectile dysfunction in men with type 2 diabetes versus those without. This is thought to be due to damage to the nerves and blood vessels in the penis. This is a subject that many men are uncomfortable discussing, even with their doctor, but is an indicator of the need for diabetes. If you are experiencing the symptoms listed above or erectile dysfunction, we recommend speaking with your doctor to see if testing is indicated.Learn more about the dietary changes required to reverse diabetes without increasing medication in Reversing Diabetes 101 by Dr. Sarah Hallberg.",diabetes
how can you prevent type 2 diabetes,"One of the most important first steps one can take to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is to reach out to a primary care provider.By doing so, it will be possible to undergo basic screening tests for type 2 diabetes.For example, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)which issues guidance on a variety of issues based on medical experts review of all relevant scientific studiesrecommends screening for abnormal blood sugars in adults aged 40 to 70 years who are considered overweight (that is, having a Body Mass Index of 25-29.9) or obese (that is, having a Body Mass Index of 30 or above).This isnt a hard-and-fast rule, however. And there are other similar organizations that issue guidelines for screening that differ slightly. The bottom line is that even if one doesnt meet the above-mentioned criteria from USPSTF, a simple discussion with ones primary care provider can lead to a personalized approach to screening thats sensible.Screening tests for type 2 diabetes will reveal one of three possible outcomes: 1) normal blood sugar, 2) somewhat elevated blood sugar (prediabetes), or 3) significantly elevated blood sugar (type 2 diabetes).In the event that screening doesnt reveal type 2 diabetes, then there are options available that can help prevent or at least delay the onset of diabetes.For all patients, smoking cessation, physical activity, and dietary changes are recommended to help bring blood sugar levels closer to the normal range.Evidence from scientific studies has shown that 150 minutes a week of either moderate aerobic exercise or weight training can help prevent type 2 diabetes.Diet and Preventing Type 2 DiabetesA growing body of evidence shows that a well-formulated ketogenic diet can improve and even reverse T2DM. Please see our related post on the best diet for type 2 diabetes.Ongoing scientific work has shown that Virta's treatment, which includes a well-formulated ketogenic diet, helps significantly lower blood sugars in those with T2DM. In Virta's clinical trial, the Virta treatment has been found to reverse T2DM in 60% of patients at one year. At present, Virta cares for patients with T2DM and those with prediabetes. Patients living with prediabetes are excited by the prospect that Virta will help prevent T2DM.There is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet can help prevent type 2 diabetes. Although theres no single, universally agreed-upon definition of a Mediterranean diet, its typically comprised mostly of nuts, whole grains, fruits, olive oil, vegetables, beans, and seeds.One medication, metformin, has been shown in multiple studies to be effective at preventing the onset of T2DM. Metformin is both inexpensive and without long-term safety concerns.The most prudent way to get on track toward preventing T2DM is to have a discussion with ones primary care provider about the above-mentioned options to help craft an individualized approach that will suit your values and needs best.",diabetes
what foods cause type 2 diabetes,"By Dr. Austin SmithThere is scientific evidence that suggests that certain foods like refined grains and sugary beverages are associated (that is, they tend to go hand-in-hand) with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies have also shown an association between eating foods that contain trans fats and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. But these studies, by their design, were not intended to evaluate whether these foods could be identified as having caused type 2 diabetes. Another type of study would be better suited to test whether certain foods can be identified as causes of type 2 diabetes. While it would be advisable to minimize ones intake of refined grains, trans fats, and sugary beverages for a number of other health reasons, it cant be said that these foods by themselves are responsible for causing type 2 diabetes.Its important to note that obesity is also associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Not everyone who is obese develops type 2 diabetes. But there is an association between obesity and developing type 2 diabetes--and that association is strong.Obesity, like type 2 diabetes, can be caused by any combination of a number of genetic and environmental factors. Among those that can be modified to prevent obesity, diet and exercise spring to the top of the list.

And the scientific evidence in support of a well-formulated ketogenic diet to improve the health of folks living with type 2 diabetes continues to pile up.The evidence is so compelling that the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recently issued a consensus report in which they acknowledge the value of a low-carbohydrate diet to help people living with type 2 diabetes.",diabetes
can a ketogenic diet reverse type 2 diabetes,"By Dr. Stephen Phinney and the Virta TeamInsulin resistance is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes and manifests as carbohydrate intolerance. Like other food intolerances, the most logical and effective approach to managing carbohydrate intolerance is to restrict sugars and starches to within the individuals metabolic tolerance. A well-formulated ketogenic diet can not only prevent and slow down progression of type-2 diabetes, it can actually resolve all the signs and symptoms in many patients, in effect reversing the disease as long as the carbohydrate restriction is maintained.Learn more here: Reversing Type 2 Diabetes with Nutritional KetosisThis video series by Dr. Sarah Hallberg is also useful: Reversing Diabetes 101",diabetes
how do i manage my medications if i make dietary changes to improve my diabetes,"By Dr. Jeff StanleyWe strongly recommend that patients with type 2 diabetes consult a medical professional before making dietary changes. Changing your diet, particularly starting the personalized, well-formulated ketogenic diet utilized by Virta, can be incredibly powerful in improving blood sugar and even reversing type 2 diabetes. However, because of the rapid blood sugar and blood pressure improvements that are seen, it is very important that you have medical supervision while making dietary changes. This is particularly important in patients taking medications like insulin or sulfonylureas, which can cause dangerously low blood glucose. In addition, newer diabetes medications such as SGLT-2 inhibitors, can lead to a dangerous condition known as euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, in which patients can have normal blood glucose but dangerous changes in the acidity of their blood.In addition, due to the rapid improvements that are often seen in blood sugar, it is important to have close monitoring of your biomarkers. This can be difficult for most clinics to provide, but is part of the continuous remote monitoring that is part of the Virta treatment. We sometimes adjust medications multiple times in one day, and often need to be proactive in reducing medications to avoid dangerous low blood sugars.Learn more about the dietary changes required to reverse prediabetes without increasing medication in Reversing Diabetes 101 by Dr. Sarah Hallberg.Citations:Hallberg SJ, McKenzie AL, Williams P, Bhanpuri NH, Peters AL, Campbell WW, Hazbun T, Volk B, McCarter JP, Phinney SD, Volek JS.

what is diabetic neuropathy,"Diabetic neuropathy can affect folks living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Elevated blood sugars can damage nerves, usually first in the legs and feet. But other nerves throughout the body can be damaged as well.Symptoms can vary considerably, and depend on the particular nerves that have been damaged. One might experience tingling, numbness, muscle weakness, or burning pains. Or one might experience a high heart rate even at rest, or even sudden decreases in blood pressure when rising to a standing position. Severity can span quite a range, from barely noticeable to significantly painful.All people living with type 2 diabetes are at risk for developing diabetic neuropathy. There are certain factors that make diabetic neuropathy more likely, however. The longer one has T2DM, the higher the risk. The higher ones blood sugars, the higher the risk. Cigarette smokers, too, carry a higher risk of developing diabetic neuropathy.Diabetic neuropathy can lead to the development of a number of other health problems. For example, numbness in the feet can make it more difficult to notice a small wound that might continue to fester unnoticed until its become infected. Such an infection could spread to other parts of the body. This could lead to joint damage or even the amputation of a limb. Diabetic neuropathy could even make it more difficult to experience symptoms like, for example, sweating, which would ordinarily alert someone with T2DM of a low blood sugar.Keeping ones blood sugars in a good range, as determined by your health care provider, can help prevent symptoms and even improve symptoms if theyve already developed. Achieving and maintaining a healthy blood pressure, as determined by your health care provider, can also help reduce the risk of developing diabetic neuropathy. Quitting smoking also helps. As can aerobic exercise.In the event the pain becomes too severe, prescription medications can be tried, although they can help only to reduce the pain, not eliminate it.Learn more about reversing diabetes through nutrition.Citations:Jameson, J.

what is diabetic retinopathy,"By Dr. Austin SmithDiabetic retinopathy can develop when a patient living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has high blood sugars that damage the blood vessels in the retina, a part of the eye thats critical to helping the brain form images that help make sense of the visible world.There are two types of diabetic retinopathy: nonproliferative and proliferative.In nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, high blood sugars lead to a weakening of the walls of the blood vessels in the retina.In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, the injured blood vessels eventually stop working, and new blood vessels form. But these new blood vessels dont work very well, either, as they can be prone to leaking. The growth of these new blood vessels can lead to the retina becoming detached, which can lead to other vision problems, including vision loss. Moreover, the newly-formed blood vessels can increase the risk of developing glaucoma.Diabetic retinopathy can cause a range of symptoms, whether its blurry vision, an inability to distinguish between colors, or vision loss. But symptoms generally dont emerge very quickly, which is why patients living with T2DM are advised to see an eye physician (ophthalmologist) on a regular basis for eye exams that can help detect the presence of diabetic retinopathy.The longer one has type 2 diabetes, the greater the risk becomes of developing diabetic retinopathy. And higher blood sugars tend to be associated with a higher risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.Not everyone with type 2 diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy. But for folks living with type 2 diabetes, keeping blood sugars under good control can help prevent severe vision loss, and even slow progression of retinopathy. Quitting smoking can also help lower ones risk, as can keeping ones blood pressure in a healthy range. In the event that severe diabetic retinopathy develops, a number of treatments can help.

what are diabetic foot problems,"There are many complications (problems) that can happen to the feet when a person is diagnosed with diabetes. These include problems with the nerves, problems with the blood vessels, and problems with healing.Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage that is caused by diabetes, and it can cause numbness, tingling, and inability to feel heat, cold, or pain in the feet. It can lead to changes in the shape of the foot and toes (also called Charcot foot). Because of the nerve damage, people who have diabetic neuropathy can injure their feet and not realize it. These injuries can cause several different types of wounds, such as ulcers, cuts, blisters, and scrapes. Once these wounds occur, they can be slow to heal and can easily develop infections.Circulation (or blood vessel) problems that are also caused by diabetes can lead to slow wound healing and infections. Infections become difficult to treat because antibiotics rely on the blood vessels to carry the antibiotic through the bloodstream to the feet and toes (where the infection is happening). It can sometimes take several weeks or months for these wounds to heal for these reasons.Other common diabetic foot problems include fungal infections and development of corns and calluses on the feet and toes. Some people also notice loss of hair on their toes, feet, and the lower part of their legs.",diabetes
what is the treatment for diabetic foot problems,"By Dr. Kelley StrubleChecking your feet on a daily basis and avoiding injuries to your feet are the best way to prevent diabetic foot problems. Keeping good control of your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels also helps slow the progression of nerve and blood vessel damage that causes diabetic foot problems. It is also best to have your feet checked by your physician or podiatrist (foot doctor) at least once a year.If you notice redness, swelling, ulcers, blisters, corns, or calluses on your feet, then notify your physician right away. This is the best way to make sure any small wounds or infections are quickly treated before they become more serious. In many cases, antibiotics are given for treatment of infections. If a wound develops, then dressings and medications are applied to the foot in order to help the wounds heal.A person with diabetic foot problems who develops a wound that either does not heal or develops a serious infection may sometimes need to have a surgery (amputation) performed in order to treat the problem. The best way to avoid this is to make sure you are seen by your physician as soon as you notice a problem with your foot.Learn more in Reversing Diabetes 101 by Dr. Sarah Hallberg.",diabetes
what is gestational diabetes,"By Dr. Kelley StrubleGestational diabetes is high blood glucose (sugar) in a pregnant woman who has never had diabetes before, and it only occurs when a woman is pregnant.The cause of this condition is not completely understood. It is thought that the hormones that are normally present during pregnancy block the effects of insulin in the mothers body. This leads to a buildup of high blood glucose levels. This condition goes away after the baby is delivered and the pregnancy hormones return to normal levels.Gestational diabetes that is not treated during the pregnancy can cause certain problems for the baby. One of these problems is a condition called macrosomia, which means the baby is born overweight. Babies with macrosomia can suffer from shoulder damage during birth, and they can have problems with their blood sugar and ability to breathe at birth as well. Protecting the baby from these problems is the main reason why diagnosing and treating gestational diabetes during the pregnancy is so important.Mothers who have gestational diabetes are at risk for developing high blood pressure during the pregnancy. This leads to a higher likelihood of having to undergo a C-section when the baby is born. In addition, the mother is at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on after the baby is born.",diabetes
what are the symptoms of gestational diabetes,"By Dr. Kelley StrubleThese symptoms can include feeling thirsty, feeling hungry, having a dry mouth, urinating often, and being tired. Because these symptoms typically occur with pregnancy anyways, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes is usually made by lab work that is routinely performed during pregnancy.Gestational diabetes usually develops during the sixth month of pregnancy or later, and this is usually when the mother will be tested for this condition. Mothers who are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes may be tested sooner than that. Typically, a glucose screening test is performed, which consists of drinking a liquid that contains glucose (sugar), and blood is drawn one hour afterwards to assess the blood glucose level. Depending on the results of the blood glucose level, a glucose tolerance test may be performed.A glucose tolerance test can consist of several steps. First, the mother will be asked to fast (not eat) the night before the test. Then, blood is drawn the next morning while the mother is still fasting. The mother will then drink the liquid glucose again and have labs drawn one hour, two hours, and three hours afterward. The lab measures the blood glucose levels at each of these intervals. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is confirmed based on the results of these tests.",diabetes
how do you prevent gestational diabetes,"The best prevention for gestational diabetes is a healthy lifestyle and a normal weight, normal blood pressure, and normal blood glucose levels before becoming pregnant.Women who are more likely to develop gestational diabetes while pregnant have high blood pressure, high blood glucose levels (but not high enough to be diabetes), and were overweight before becoming pregnant. Also, women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy are more likely to develop it if they become pregnant again.",diabetes
what is diabetes,"When our body is unable to properly use and store glucose, the disease is referred as diabetes (Diabetes Mellitus). Glucose comes back in the bloodstream and hence the persons blood glucose (commonly called as blood sugar) levels shoot up high.Type 1  This used to be called  juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes as it is commonly seen in children & young adults. However, it can occur at any age.Insulin is a hormone that helps our body to use glucose from the food that we eat and convert it to energy units. In type 1 diabetes, the body is unable to produce insulin. Hence, the person must take insulin injections every day.Type 2  This used to be called  adult-onset or non insulin-dependent diabetes as it usually occurs in people above 40 years, overweight and have a family history of diabetes. However, due to sedentary lifestyle, it is seen more in younger age group. Type 2 diabetes can often get unnoticed or undiagnosed for years.In this condition, our body doesnt produce enough insulin and or is unable to use insulin properly (also called as insulin resistance). See the illustration below:Gestational diabetes  This form of diabetes occurs only during pregnancy & often strikes between 24th & 28th week of pregnacny. It poses serious risk for both the mother and child. Although, the condition typically ends after delivery, these women often have about 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the next 7-10 years. Timely diagnosis is extremely important to reduce the incidence of this condition. With proper diet and nutrition and careful management of diabetes, women can and do have successful pregancies and also deliver healthy babies.",diabetes
what are the common symptoms of diabetes,"People with diabetes, often experience symptoms as shown in this illustration.Apart from these, some people also experience  Increased hunger, Irritability, Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet, Frequent infections of skin, bladder or gums etc. In some people, there are absolutely no symptoms and for months or even years people can live without knowing that they have diabetes. As per International Diabetes Federation (IDF), one in every two adults having diabetes is UNDIAGNOSED. Regular screening is therefore very important.",diabetes
what are the risk factors for diabetes,"Any one can get diabetes. However, some of the common risk factors are shown in the illustration below.In addition to these, high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, smoking etc. are also considered to be major risk factors for diabetes.",diabetes
what is normal level of blood sugar,"Fasting plasma blood glucose level of 99mg dL or less is considered to be normal. When a person has fasting plasma blood glucose in the range of 100-125mg dL then it is defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG). If the doctor gives glucose to this person and after 2 hours, the blood glucose levels are in the range of 140-199mg dL, it is termed as having impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). These are the medical terms for a condition commonly called as pre-diabetes.People with pre-diabetes have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes within a decade unless they switch to a healthier lifestyle including weight loss, proper diet and physical activity. Person is said to have diabetes when his her fasting plasma blood glucose levels are 126mg dL or higher at two separate occasions.",diabetes
how will i know if i have prediabetes or diabetes,"Timely screening and early detection can help prevent diabetes and its complications.If you are overweight, above 45 years or if you are under 45 years, overweight and having one or more of the below risk factors, you should get tested a. If you are having phycially inactive lifestyleb. If you are previously identified to have impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)c. If you have family history of diabetesd. If you are having high blood pressuree. If your level of HDL (good) cholesterol is 35mg dL or lower and or triglyceride level is 250mg dL or higherf. If you have a previous history of vascular diseaseConsider two additional risk factors if you are a womang. If you had gestational diabetes or had given birth to a baby weighing more than 4 Kg (9 pounds)h. If you have polycystic ovary syndromeAppropriate prevention strategies for delaying or avoiding the onset of diabetes and also cardiovascular diseases can be determined by assessing cardiometabolic risk.For the first time in Gujarat, Advanced Diabetes Centre (ADCPL) has installed a specialised state-of-the-art EZSCAN, a non-invasive 2-minute test that provides immediate results. This test does not require any patient preparation, fasting or drawing blood sample. EZSCAN is a dynamic test equivalent to a stress test.Recent clinical studies have shown EZSCAN to be highly accurate, and reproducible in direct comparison with conventional blood tests, thus making it a reliable screening test.Advanced Diabetes Centre (ADCPL) has critically sensed the need for non-invasive, accurate and sensitive tool for the early screening of diabtes complications that can be performed before the disease progresses to the point at which costly procedures become unavoidable.",diabetes
why is it that diabetes is considered to be so serious disease,"One in 11 adults across the world has diabetes  such high was the prevalence of diabetes in 2015 as per International Diabetes Federation (IDF). There are about 78 million people living with diabetes in South-East Asia Region (comprising 7 countries  India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Bhutan & the Maldives).With these high numbers, diabetes has become one of the largest global health emergencies of the 21st century.International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that world over approximately 5 million people died from diabetes; this number is significantly higher compared to number of adults who died from HIV AIDS, tuberculosis & malaria. In India alone, about one million deaths were attributable to diabetes during 2015.",diabetes
what are the complications associated with diabetes,"As a chronic disease, Diabetes demands chronic attention. Regular exercise, proper diet, medications and regular monitoring of blood sugar helps in keeping blood glucose levels in normal range as far as possible. Poorly managed or uncontrolled diabetes often leads to multiple long-term complications such as a. Heart attacksb. Strokec. Kidney failure (Nephropathy)d. Blindness (Diabetic Retinopathy)e. Blood vessel damagef. Nerve damage (Diabetic Neuropathy)g. Wounds and ulcers leading to amputationsh. Impotence in menIn addition to these chronic complications, the person living with diabetes can also experience acute complications such as hypoglycemia, diabetes keto-acidosis (DKA). We shall learn about these later separately.",diabetes
who gets these complications due to diabetes will i get them,"Poorly managed or uncontrolled diabetes often leads to the long-term complications. Hence, proper diet, regular exercise along with prescribed medications and regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is very essential in the management of diabetes.India is a home to about 70 million people living with diabetes. All those who are careless about monitoring and maintaining their blood glucose levels and follow a disciplined lifestyle with proper diet, regular exercise & medications are liable to fall prey to the life-threatening complications due to diabetes.If you dont pay proper attention to managing diabetes, in the long run, even you can be a victim of these complications. However, routine check-up by diabetes specialists, regular blood glucose monitoring, proper examinations of feet, eyes, nerves etc. in regular intervals, an active lifestyle coupled with balanced diet and medications help prevent these complications due to diabetes.",diabetes
can we prevent these complications due to diabetes,"Yes, we can certainly prevent these complications due to diabetes. Heres what every person living with diabetes should do a. Consult with diabetes specialist (an endocrinologist or a diabetologist) at least once every six monthsb. Periodically consult other members of a diabetes treatment team, including a certified diabetes educator, and a dietitian who will help develop an individualized meal plan for youc. Meet and seek advice from an exercise physiologist for developing a physical activity plan d. Get regular eye exams (once a year) by an eye doctor expert in diabetes eye care to make sure that any eye problems associated with diabetes are caught early and treated before they become seriouse. Get your feet examined (once a year) by expert podiatrist to ensure that no abnormalities are left unnoticed. Proper footwear with appropriate insoles is also recommended for people living with diabetes to prevent injuries to feetf. Also, get your nerves (of hand & feet) examined (once a year) as nerve damage due to diabetes can often lead to serious injuriesg. Consult a social worker, psychologist or other mental health professional at least once a year for help with the stresses and challenges of living with a chronic disease like diabetes",diabetes
how is diabetes treated,"Every person whether he she has Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, has to have a customised diet plan, watch out the physical activity that they are doing. Physical activity helps our body to utilise insulin better so it can convert glucose to energy units for body cells. People with Type 1 diabetes and some people with Type 2 diabetes have to take insulin injections. People living with Type 2 diabetes also have to take other medicines orally to better control their blood glucose levels. People living with diabetes should know how to monitor their blood glucose levels regularly.Diabetes is a chronic disease and therefore needs a chronic attention. Every person living with diabetes should consult diabetes specialist doctor (endocrinologist or diabetologist) at least once every six months. Consultation with Dietitian, Physiotherapist, Diabetes Educator is also very important when it comes to effectively control the disease. Regular examination of eyes (once a year) by an expert eye specialist is also mandatory. Examination of feet, nerve damage assessment (once every 6 months) is also important to prevent complications.Long term complications of diabetes viz. heart attack, kidney failure, stroke, nerve damage, blindness, amputation etc. can easily be prevented if the person takes proper care from all the angles and not just by managing through his her diet, exercise and medications. Diabetes management therefore needs a complete organised care.",diabetes

are there any specific foods that can control my diabetes,"Yes, there are certain foods which are not only useful in controlling blood sugars but also provide many other important health benefits. These are called functional food. The functional foods are the natural or processed foods that contain known or unknown biologically-active compounds; which in defined amounts provide a clinically proven and documented health benefit for the prevention, management, or treatment of chronic diseases. However, it is very important to consult a qualified dietitian in order to get its maximum benefit.",diabetes
what are the forms of functional food,"Functional food can be the natural foods or they may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders & liquids. Do not start any of them without the prescription of the dietitian as not all of them are safe for you.",diabetes
are functional foods safe for diabetes,"Natural functional foods if taken in a prescribed amount are found to be safe. However, functional foods in the form of capsules, powders or decoctions or any other form may not be safe due to the safety, quality, strength & contamination concerns associated with them. Some of the functional foods can also interact with the medications & can cause hypoglycemia, allergic reactions or other side effects. They might also interfere with your medication. It is also important to monitor blood sugar levels if on any food supplement. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a qualified dietitian before starting any nutritional supplements claiming guaranteed sugar control & has to be taken under strict supervision of dietitians & doctors. Be careful to use over the counter nutritional supplements.",diabetes
i will not require medications if i am taking functional foods,"Functional foods do help to control blood sugar levels if taken in a right form & dose at right time. However, they cannot replace diabetic medications. You may still require medications. If your blood sugar levels are under control, the diabetologist might change or reduce the dose of medications. It is important to note that patients should inform their doctor, diabetes educator or dietitian if they are taking any such supplements.",diabetes
i do not have to follow a diet if i am taking functional foods,Healthy eating is absolutely necessary. Functional foods act as enhancers. One can get maximum benefits of the functional foods if they are following a healthy lifestyle. Functional foods without proper diet modifications will not provide the health benefits.,diabetes
i can have functional foods as much as i want,"Foods do act as a medicine. Hence, just like the medicines, the dosage of the food is atmost important. They may cause adverse reactions like gastric disturbances, hypoglycaemia etc. if taken beyond that dose.",diabetes
can i control sugar by taking jamun powder methi karela,"Jamun powder, methi & karela fall into the category of functional foods & there is growing scientific evidence to support its effectiveness in controlling diabetes. However, they alone cannot be used to control diabetes. Moreover, there are many factors which will determine their effectiveness like when you are taking it, how it is prepared, its dose etc. They will not be effective in controlling sugar if taken in wrong way. Only a qualified dietitian will help you to find the right foods for you.",diabetes
can i take these foods for lifetime,Some of these foods can be taken indefinitely. Others are meant to be taken for a short period.,diabetes
can i take food supplements with medications,Supplements can interact with many medications. These interactions can be serious. One needs to consult the dietitian or diabetes educator to avoid unnecessary consequences.,diabetes
everybody can use these food supplements,"The supplements may not be safe for all the people. Children, people with multiple health problems, pregnant & lactating mothers, people going for surgeries should avoid taking these supplements unless they advised by the doctors.",diabetes
how to identify gestational diabetes,"Several symptoms are associated with the disease and they may vary from patient to patient. Increased thirst and urination, weight loss despite of increased appetite, frequent infections including bladder, vaginal, and skin are among the symptoms.",diabetes
how insulin helps diabetes,"Insulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the blood stream and enter the cells. People with type I diabetes cannot make their own insulin in the body and must take insulin injections to meet the regular requirement. They can survive without insulin injections, but many may take insulin injections to control blood glucose levels more effectively. Insulin is taken as an injection. Patients who need insulin is taught to give his her injections themselves.In type II diabetes, the patient's body makes insulin, but is not able to use it effectively. They use medicines to control blood sugar in the form of pills, usually once or twice a day. These medicines work by preventing the body from sending sugar into the bloodstream when the naturally produced insulin is not working properly, releasing more Insulin into the bloodstream, and helping the body's own insulin move glucose from the bloodstream into the cells. Some people need insulin in addition to oral medicines. Some people no longer need medicines if they lose weight because their own insulin output is sufficient after reducing weight, fat, and sugar.Insulin is taken as an injection. It is not available in tablet form.",diabetes
what to eat when your blood sugar level is not normal,"Diet planning for diabetes includes choosing healthy foods, eating the right amount of food at the right time. Meal plans differ depending on the type of diabetes.In insulin-dependent diabetes (Type I), following a fixed time daily to eat and the amounts and kind of food eaten is very important to allow food and insulin to work together to regulate blood glucose levels. If meals and insulin are out of balance, extreme variations in blood glucose can occur.In Non insulin-dependent diabetes (Type II), weight control is the most important principle in addition to a well-balanced diet. The doctor and dietician will help you to chalk out a diet plan to follow.",diabetes
what happens if you miss a dose of insulin,"In insulin-dependent diabetics when a dose of insulin is missed or if infection is present, weakness, drowsiness, headache, double vision, lack of coordination and convulsions or unconsciousness can occur.",diabetes
why diabetics should give more care to their feet,"People with diabetes are prone to foot problems because of complications caused by damage to large and small blood vessels and nerves, and decreased ability to fight infection. To prevent injury to the feet, diabetics should regularly checkup their feet.",diabetes
do sugars cause diabetes,"So far the researchers do not know why diabetes occurs, but they know sugars do not cause it. During physical activity, they are the main energy source.Diabetes is a disorder in the way the body handles sugars. People with diabetes do not make enough insulin. Or they cannot use the insulin their bodies do make.",diabetes
how is diabetes diagnosed,"Urine analysis:A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes. Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg dL. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done. Blood tests : Fasting blood glucose test, hemoglobin A1c test, and oral glucose tolerance test are blood test that can be done to diagnose diabetes.Screening: Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for: overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes (starting at age 10), overweight adults (BMI greater than 25) who have other risk factors, and adults over age 45.",diabetes
 how does covid19 spread,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.",covid
 what are the symptoms of covid19,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but dont develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",covid
 how do i know if it is covid19 or just the common flu,"A COVID-19 infection has the same signs and symptoms as the common cold and you can only differentiate them through laboratory testing to determine the virus type. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, you should seek medical attention and immediately isolate yourself from others. Call your local UN clinic medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant travel exposure history. If you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this. From here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested.",covid
 can the virus that causes covid19 be transmitted through the air,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.,covid
 what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease,"Protection measures for everyone Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.",covid
 i am well and asymptomatic should i use a mask,"According to the WHO, for individuals without respiratory symptoms, a medical mask is not required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons. However, masks might be worn in some countries according to local cultural habits. If masks are used, best practices should be followed on how to wear, remove, and dispose of them and on hand hygiene action after removal. For more information, visit the WHO guidance on use of masks in the community.",covid
 how likely am i to catch covid19,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Its important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide. You can see these at https:www.who.int emergencies diseases novel-coronavirus- 2019 situation-reports ",covid
 are pregnant women more susceptible to the covid19 virus and will it harm the       fetus,"We do not have information from published scientific reports about the susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes, which might make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly by close contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets. Whether a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can transmit the virus that causes COVID-19 to her fetus or neonate by other routes of vertical transmission (before, during, or after delivery) is still unknown.",covid
 what is the risk of my child becoming sick with covid19,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on CDCs current Risk Assessment page.",covid
 are the symptoms of covid19 different in children than in adults,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.",covid
 should i worry about covid19,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost, among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings.",covid
 who is at risk of developing severe illness,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.",covid
 are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating covid19,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.",covid
 are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure covid19,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines.",covid
 is there a vaccine drug or treatment for covid19,"Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus).",covid
 should i wear a mask to protect myself from catching the covid19 virus,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely. WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks). The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information.",covid
 until when should i wear a mask after recovering from an illness with respiratory       symptoms,"In order to avoid infecting others, you should use a mask for as long as you are still coughing or sneezing. You should only stop after a complete recovery (which means 24-48 hours after having no symptoms without medication).",covid
 i am looking after someone who is ill with suspect or confirmed covid what       precautions should i take,"You should limit the movement around the house of the individual who is ill and minimize shared space. Ensure shared spaces like bathrooms, and the kitchen are well ventilated. One way to do this is by keeping the windows open. Clean and disinfect the bathroom and toilet surface at least once a day using regular household soap or detergent for cleaning and then disinfecting with a regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. Do not forget the importance of hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand-rub or soap and water (if hands are visibly soiled). Whenever possible, household members should stay in a different room or maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from the ill person. When helping care for the sick individual, wear a tightly fitted medical surgical mask that covers your nose and mouth when in the same room as the affected individual. Make sure you are careful not to touch your mask. If your mask gets wet or dirty, it should be replaced. When removing a mask, it is important to throw it away and perform hand hygiene. Dispose of any material with respiratory secretions immediately after use. Both the ill individual and you, as the caregiver, should perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions.",covid

Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.",covid
 how long does the virus survive on surfaces,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.",covid
 how can i get tested for covid19,"If you are well, no testing is recommended. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, you should immediately isolate yourself from others. Call your local UN clinic medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant travel exposure history.

From here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested.",covid
 what alternatives do i have if there are no hand sanitizers available,"Can I use other alcohol like ethyl or liquor? If hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is the recommended, and even better, alternative. Liquor is not effective against coronavirus. For an alcohol-based hand rub to be effective, it must have an alcohol content of 60% to 95%.",covid
 can people who recover from covid19 be infected again,"We know that for similar coronaviruses, infected people are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover. However, because the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood, it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients who have recovered from COVID-19.",covid
 is it safe to receive a package from an area where covid19 has been reported,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.",covid

 my colleague is sick but heshe insists that it is just the common cold and is reluctant to work from home what steps can we take to enforce ãƒæãâãƒâãâåãâãƒâãâåstaying at home when not well amongst staff,"While it is very likely that your colleague is only suffering from the common cold or flu, all precautions should, nevertheless, be taken. Managers should encourage staff members with flu symptoms to telecommute for some time until the symptoms have abated. Alternatively, if the staff member is feeling unfit, he she should take sick leave. This is a sensible approach at any time to prevent the spreading of flu or other seasonal viruses. Supervisors are also encouraged to exercise flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements if the staff member would like to limit their contact with others and work from home.",covid

 can covid19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms,"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. ",covid
 how likely am i to catch covid19,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Its important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. ",covid
 is covid19 the same as sars,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.

 what is the fda process for a covid19 vaccine authorized for emergency use versus an fdaapproved covid19 vaccine,"Emergency use authorizations (EUAs)can be used by the FDA during public health emergencies to provide access to unapproved vaccines (or unapproved uses of an approved vaccine) that may be effective in preventing a disease. Emergency use authorization is a tool that the FDA can use in a declared public health emergency, like the current pandemic, to more rapidly make available potentially life-saving products under very specific conditions. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a vaccine, after the FDA receives a request for an EUA, the agency evaluates the data submitted, conducts its own analyses and assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits.For the COVID-19 vaccines that the FDA has authorized for emergency use, the agency evaluated data submitted by the manufacturers about the vaccines safety and effectiveness, conducted its own analyses of the data, and determined that the vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The FDA has determined that the totality of the available data provide evidence that the vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccines use in millions of people.A vaccine that the FDA approved for use in the U.S. has undergone the agencys standard scientific and regulatory evaluation processes. The FDAs process to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine relies upon the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) by a company. By submitting a BLA to the FDA, a company is seeking permission to distribute and market a vaccine for use in the United States.The FDAs evaluation to determine the safety and effectiveness of vaccines is among the most comprehensive in the world. This includes the agencys independent verification of analyses submitted by the company in the BLA, our own analyses of the data, along with a detailed assessment of the manufacturing processes, test methods and manufacturing facilities.For the COVID-19 vaccines, a BLA builds upon the data and information that supported the EUA, such as preclinical and clinical data, as well as details of the manufacturing process and the sites where the vaccine is made. After its evaluation, the FDA decides whether to approve (also known as to license) the vaccine for use in the U.S. If the FDA approves the vaccine, the company is permitted to market it in the U.S. for use in the population for which it is approved.",covid

 can a covid19 vaccine cause infertility in women," There is no scientific evidence to suggest that FDA-authorized or FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines could cause infertility in women. In addition, infertility is not known to occur as a result of natural COVID-19 disease, further demonstrating that immune responses to the virus, whether induced by infection or a vaccine, are not a cause of infertility. Reports on social media have falsely asserted that the COVID-19 vaccine could cause infertility in women and the FDA is concerned that this misinformation may cause women to avoid vaccination to prevent COVID-19, which is a potentially serious and life-threatening disease. The symptoms of COVID-19 vary and are unpredictable; many people have no symptoms or only mild disease, while some have severe respiratory disease including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death.SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Comirnaty, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Spikevax) contain a piece of the SARS-CoV-2 viruss genetic material that instructs cells in the body to make the viruss distinctive spike protein. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine uses a type of adenovirus that cannot replicate to deliver a piece of the DNA, or genetic material, that is used to make the distinctive spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.After a person is vaccinated, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, and triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Contrary to false reports on social media, this protein is not the same as any involved in formation of the placenta.",covid
 can the fda help me get a covid19 vaccine," No. The FDAs authority includes authorizing or approving COVID-19 vaccines for use in the U.S., but the FDA is not responsible for vaccine distribution.Search vaccines.gov, text your zip code to 438829, or call 1-800-232-0233 to find COVID-19 vaccine locations near you.Go to the CDC website to find your state and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution.

 why is the fda providing flexibility to food manufacturers under limited circumstances during the covid19 public health emergency to make minor changes in ingredients without reflecting those changes on the package label,"Due to limited shortages of specific ingredients and foods, or unexpected supply chain disruptions in some industries, food manufacturers may need to make small changes to some ingredients during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Manufacturers may not be able to relabel their products to reflect these minor changes on the food label without slowing down the processing or distribution of the food.To avoid slowing down food processing or distribution during the coronavirus pandemic, the FDA issued a guidance titled ""Temporary Policy Regarding Certain Food Labeling Requirements During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency: Minor Formulation Changes and Vending Machines."" The temporary policy provides food manufacturers with flexibility to make minor formulation changes in certain, limited circumstances without making conforming label changes on packages as long as any substitutions or omissions of ingredients do not pose a health or safety issue (such as allergens), and do not cause significant changes in the finished product.",covid
 what do i need to know about the temporary policy for food labeling of minor ingredient changes during the covid19 public health emergency if i have food allergies,"Although the temporary policy allows some flexibility, the eight major food allergens under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) of 2004 cannot be substituted for labeled ingredients by manufacturers without a corresponding label change. While the temporary policy does not list all ingredients known to cause sensitivities in some people, manufacturers should avoid substituting ingredients with major food allergens or with ingredients recognized as priority allergens (such as sesame, celery, lupin, buckwheat, molluscan shellfish, and mustard) in other parts of the world without a label change. These flexibilities are intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency in the United States. However, when this public health emergency is over, extensions may be needed if the food and agriculture sectors need additional time to bring supply chains back into regular order.

what is covid19,COVID-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person.,covid
how does the virus spread,"SARS-CoV-2 typically spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. When an infected person sneezes, coughs, talks, or breathes, it releases droplets. Someone nearby can inhale the droplets into their lungs, or the droplets can land in their eyes, nose, or mouth, infecting them.Infected droplets also can land on surfaces or objects. When a person touches those surfaces and then touches their nose, mouth, or eyes without washing their hands, this also can cause an infection.If a person is infected, they can spread the coronavirus even if they don't have symptoms of COVID-19.",covid
who is at risk of getting coronavirus,"People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are at the greatest risk of infection. However, the COVID-19 vaccine can significantly reduce your risk of infection. The COVID-19 vaccines are effective against COVID-19, especially in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death.Certain groups of people also are more at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including hospitalization and death. People more at risk of COVID-19 complications include older adults and people with existing medical conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, and more. Unvaccinated people also are at greater risk for severe illness than vaccinated people.",covid

does the vaccine have any side effects,"The most common side effects of the vaccines include pain and swelling where you received the shot, fever, chills, fatigue, and headache. These are common for many vaccines because a vaccine triggers an immune response. The side effects should go away within a few days.",covid
what if im allergic to the vaccine,"There have been some reports of isolated allergic reactions to the vaccine, which scientists are investigating. Allergic reactions to vaccines are not common and are typically mild.The COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are mRNA-based. If you previously had an allergic reaction to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Ask your doctor if you should get a different type of COVID-19 vaccine.If you had an allergic reaction to the first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, ask your doctor if you should get a different type of COVID-19 vaccine.If you have previously had an allergic reaction to any ingredient in the Johnson & Johnson Janssen (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the J&J vaccine. Ask your doctor if you should get a different type of COVID-19 vaccine.If you have a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction to a vaccine, vaccine component, or injectable medication, you should consult your primary care physician or allergist before receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.If you have allergies that dont relate to vaccines or injectable medicines, the CDC recommends you get the COVID-19 vaccine.",covid
do covid19 vaccines contain a live virus,"No.The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. mRNA is genetic material our body naturally makes, and in this vaccine, this tiny piece of genetic material teaches our cells how to make a virus protein that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what helps to protect us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies. The mRNA and protein quickly disappear after they have taught our body to respond to the virus.For more information on COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA, read our article.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, meanwhile, is a viral vector vaccine. A viral vector vaccine uses a different virus as the vector  i.e., the mechanism that delivers instructions to your body. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses an adenovirus  a common virus that typically causes the cold or flu symptoms. Scientists added a piece of the coronavirus genetic material to the adenovirus. When you receive the vaccine, your body recognizes the coronavirus genetic material and creates antibodies against it. Although the adenovirus can enter your cells, you cannot get sick from it.For more about viral vector vaccines, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions website.",covid
should pregnant women get vaccinated,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccination for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to become pregnant now, or who may become pregnant in the future. Pregnant women are at higher risk for COVID-19 complications, including severe illness, so vaccination is a key preventive step. The benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccination outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) also recommend COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women.",covid
does the covid19 vaccine affect fertility,"No.Despite online rumors that the COVID-19 vaccine can affect fertility, this is not true. The COVID-19 vaccine has no impact on fertility in men or women.",covid

what are the benefits of getting vaccinated,"Vaccines save millions of lives each year and a COVID-19 vaccine could save yours. The COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, providing strong protection against serious illness and death. WHO reports that unvaccinated people have at least 10 times higher risk of death from COVID-19 than someone who has been vaccinated.It is important to be vaccinated as soon as its your turn, even if you already had COVID-19. Getting vaccinated is a safer way for you to develop immunity from COVID-19 than getting infected.The COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but no vaccine provides 100 per cent protection. Some people will still get ill from COVID-19 after vaccination or pass the virus onto someone else.Therefore, it is important to continue practicing safety precautions to protect yourself and others, including avoiding crowded spaces, physical distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask.",covid
who should be vaccinated first,"Each country must identify priority populations, which WHO recommends are frontline health workers (to protect health systems) and those at highest risk of death due to COVID-19, such as older adults and people with certain medical conditions. Other essential workers, such as teachers and social workers, should then be prioritized, followed by additional groups as more vaccine doses become available.The risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is very low amongst healthy children and adolescents, so unless they are part of a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than these priority groups.Children and adolescents who are at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19, such as those with underlying illnesses, should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccines.",covid
when shouldnt you be vaccinated against covid19,"If you have any questions about whether you should receive a COVID-19 vaccine, speak to your healthcare provider. At present, people with the following health conditions should not receive a COVID-19 vaccine to avoid any possible adverse effects:If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to any ingredients of a COVID-19 vaccine.If you are currently sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 (although you can get vaccinated once you have recovered and your doctor has approved).",covid
should i get vaccinated if i already had covid19,"Yes, you should get vaccinated even if youve previously had COVID-19. While people who recover from COVID-19 may develop natural immunity to the virus, it is still not certain how long that immunity lasts or how well it protects you against COVID-19 reinfection. Vaccines offer more reliable protection, especially against severe illness and death. Vaccination policies after COVID-19 infection vary by country. Check with your health care provider on the recommendation where you live.",covid
which covid19 vaccine is best for me,"All WHO-approved vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at protecting you against severe illness and death from COVID-19. The best vaccine to get is the one most readily available to you.You can find a list of those approved vaccines on WHOs site.Remember, if your vaccination involves two doses, its important to receive both to have the maximum protection. Additional doses (boosters) may be recommended by your local health authority for specific groups.",covid
how do covid19 vaccines work,"Vaccines work by mimicking an infectious agent  viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms that can cause a disease. This teaches our immune system to rapidly and effectively respond against it.Traditionally, vaccines have done this by introducing a weakened form of an infectious agent that allows our immune system to build a memory of it. This way, our immune system can quickly recognize and fight it before it makes us ill. Thats how some of the COVID-19 vaccines have been designed.Other COVID-19 vaccines have been developed using new approaches, which are called messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines. Instead of introducing antigens (a substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies), mRNA vaccines give our body the genetic code it needs to allow our immune system to produce the antigen itself. mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades. They contain no live virus and do not interfere with human DNA.For more information on how vaccines work, please visit WHO.",covid
are covid19 vaccines safe,"Yes, COVID-19 vaccines have been safely used to vaccinate billions of people. The COVID-19 vaccines were developed as rapidly as possible, but they all must go through rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and effectiveness. Only if they meet these standards can a vaccine receive validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies.UNICEF will only procure and supply COVID-19 vaccines that meet WHOs established safety and efficacy criteria and that have received the required regulatory approval.",covid
how were covid19 vaccines developed so quickly,"Scientists were able to develop safe effective vaccines in a relatively short amount of time due to a combination of factors that allowed them to scale up research and production without compromising safety:Because of the global pandemic, there was a larger sample size to study and tens of thousands of volunteers stepped forwardAdvancements in technology (like mRNA vaccines) that were years in the makingGovernments and other bodies came together to remove the obstacle of funding research and developmentManufacturing of the vaccines occurred in parallel to the clinical trials to speed up productionThough they were developed quickly, all COVID-19 vaccines approved for use by the WHO are safe and effective.",covid
what are the side effects of covid19 vaccines,"Vaccines are designed to give you immunity without the dangers of getting the disease. Not everyone does, but its common to experience some mild-to-moderate side effects that go away within a few days on their own.Some of the mild-to-moderate side effects you may experience after vaccination include:Arm soreness at the injection siteMild feverFatigueHeadachesMuscle or joint achesChillsDiarrhoeaYou can manage any side effects with rest, staying hydrated and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed.If any symptoms continue for more than a few days then contact your healthcare provider for advice. More serious side effects are extremely rare, but if you experience a more severe reaction, then contact your healthcare provider immediately.>>Read: What you need to know before, during and after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine",covid
how do i find out more about a particular covid19 vaccine,You can find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on WHOs website.,covid
can i stop taking precautions after being vaccinated,"Keep taking precautions to protect yourself, family and friends if there is still COVID-19 in your area, even after getting vaccinated. The COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against serious illness and death, but no vaccine is 100% effective.The vaccines offer less protection against infection from the Omicron variant, which is now the dominant variant globally, but remain highly effective in preventing hospitalization, severe disease, and death. In addition to vaccination, it remains important to continue practicing safety precautions to protect yourself and others. These precautions include avoiding crowded spaces, physical distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask (as per local policies).",covid
can i still get covid19 after i have been vaccinated what are breakthrough cases,"A number of vaccinated people may get infected with COVID-19, which is called a breakthrough infection. In such cases, people are much more likely to only have milder symptoms. Vaccine protection against serious illness and death remains strong.With more infectious virus variants such as Omicron, there have been more breakthrough infections. Thats why it's recommended to continue taking precautions such as avoiding crowded spaces, wearing a mask and washing your hands regularly, even if you are vaccinated.And remember, its important to receive all of the recommended doses of vaccines to have the maximum protection.If you have been fully vaccinated but are showing symptoms of COVID-19, you should contact your doctor about whether you should get tested.",covid
how long does protection from covid19 vaccines last,"Research is still ongoing to determine how long COVID-19 vaccines provide protection. According to WHO, most people have strong protection against serious illness and death for at least six months. This immunity may reduce faster for some people, including older age groups and those with underlying medical conditions.",covid
do the covid19 vaccines protect against variants like delta and omicron,"The WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines continue to be highly effective at preventing severe illness and death, including against the Delta variant.However, the vaccines offer less protection against infection from Omicron, which is now the dominant variant globally. That's why it's important to get vaccinated and continue measures to reduce the spread of the virus which helps to reduce the chances for the virus to mutate including physical distancing, mask wearing, good ventilation, regular handwashing and seeking care early if you have symptoms.",covid

Getting vaccinated while pregnant helps to protect your baby.For more information about receiving a COVID-19 vaccination while pregnant, speak to your healthcare provider.>>Read: Navigating pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic",covid
im breastfeeding should i get vaccinated against covid19,"Yes, if you are breastfeeding you should take the vaccine as soon as it is available to you. It is very safe and there is no risk to the mother or baby. None of the current COVID-19 vaccines have live virus in them, so there is no risk of you transmitting COVID-19 to your baby through your breastmilk from the vaccine. In fact, the antibodies that you have after vaccination may go through the breast milk and help protect your baby.>>Read: Breastfeeding safely during the COVID-19 pandemic",covid

should my child or teen get a covid19 vaccine,"An increasing number of vaccines are now being approved for use in children, so its important to stay informed of guidance by your local and national health authorities.The Pfizer vaccine has been approved by WHO for use in children 5 years and older, and the Moderna vaccine has been approved for children 12 years and older.Many countries have licensed other COVID-19 vaccines for children and adolescents. Theyve made them available after examining the data on the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. The best thing to do is follow your own countrys guidelines when it comes to what vaccines are authorized and available for children and adolescents.Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, so unless they are part of a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers. Check with your local authorities to find out the timing of vaccinations for children where you live.Remind your children of the importance of us all taking precautions to protect each other, such as avoiding crowded spaces, physical distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask.It is critical that children continue to receive the recommended childhood vaccines.",covid
how do i talk to my kids about covid19 vaccines,"News about COVID-19 vaccines is flooding our daily lives and it is only natural that curious young minds will have questions  lots of them. Read our explainer article for help explaining what can be a complicated topic in simple and reassuring terms.Its important to note that from the millions of children that have so far been vaccinated against COVID-19 globally, we know that side effects are very rare. Just like adults, children and adolescents might experience mild symptoms after receiving a dose, such as a slight fever and body aches. But these symptoms typically last for just a day or two.

how can i protect my family until we are all vaccinated,"Safe and effective vaccines are a game changer, but even once vaccinated we need to continue taking precautions for the time being to protect ourselves and others. Variants like Omicron have proven that although COVID-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing severe disease, theyre not enough to stop the spread of the virus alone. The most important thing you can do is reduce your risk of exposure to the virus. To protect yourself and your loved ones, make sure to:Wear a mask where physical distancing from others is not possible.Keep a physical distance from others in public places.Avoid poorly ventilated or crowded spaces.Open windows to improve ventilation indoors.Try and focus on outdoor activities if possible.Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.If you or a family member has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early and avoid mixing with other children and adults.",covid
can covid19 vaccines affect your dna,"No, none of the COVID-19 vaccines affect or interact with your DNA in any way. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines teach the cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response inside the body. This response produces antibodies which keep you protected against the virus. mRNA is different from DNA and only stays inside the cell for about 72 hours before degrading.

symptoms of a heart attack,"Symptoms of a heart attackSymptoms of a heart attack can include:chest pain a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chestpain in other parts of the body  it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummyfeeling lightheaded or dizzysweatingshortness of breathfeeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)coughing or wheezingThe chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.While the most common symptom in both men and women is chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain.Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack. The faster you act, the better their chances.",heart
treating heart attacks,"Treating heart attacksWhile waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin.Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart.In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is.The 2 main treatments are:using medicines to dissolve blood clotssurgery to help restore blood to the heart",heart
causes of a heart attack,"Causes of a heart attackCoronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks.CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known asplaques.Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing ablood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.",heart
recovering from a heart attack,"Recovering from a heart attackThe time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle.Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. Some people are well enough to return to work after 2 weeks. Other people may take several months to recover. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do.The recovery process aims to:reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such asstatins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levelsgradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation)Find out more about recovering from a heart attack",heart
complications of a heart attack,"Complications of a heart attackComplications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening.These include:arrhythmias  these are abnormal heartbeats. 1 type is where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest)cardiogenic shock  where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functionsheart rupture  where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture)These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death.Many people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack.The outlook often depends on:age  serious complications are more likely as you get olderthe severity of the heart attack  how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attackhow long it took before a person received treatment  treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possibleFind out more about complications of a heart attack",heart
when did the cpr guidelines change,"In October, 2015 the American Heart Association issued new guidelines for the performance of CPR. The major change compared to the prior guidelines is to start with chest compressions rather than ventilations. Thus the new sequence is:Check for unresponsiveness and lack of breathing or abnormal breathing.Activate emergency response (call 911 in the US and Canada).Perform 30 chest compressions - push hard and push fast in the center of the chest at a rate of 100-200 per minute and a depth of 2-2.4 inches.If you are trained give 2 ventilation and then alternate 30 compressions with 2 ventilations.If you are not trained in ventilations continue with chest compressions.",heart
why did these guidelines change,"Recent animal and human data suggests that CPR is more likely to succeed if the heart is full of blood, especially just prior to a defibrillatory shock, and the best way to accomplish this is with adequate chest compressions. Since it is very difficult for an untrained persons to perform adequate mouth-to-mouth ventilations it is better that emphasis be placed on continuous chest compressions.",heart
when should i do handsonly cpr,"The American Heart Association recommends hands-only CPR in the following circumstances: If a bystander, not trained in standard CPR, sees an adult suddenly collapse or come upon a collapsed person then he or she should call 911 and provide chest compressions by pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest. Interruptions should be kept to a minimum until trained rescuers arrive. For bystanders previously trained in standard CPR, hand-only CPR may be performed if the bystander is not confident or is unwilling to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation.",heart
what is the correct action where someone needs to be moved to perform cpr such as a car accident does the risk of additional harm such as spinal injury or bleeding outweigh the benefits of cpr if nobody qualified is on scene,"If the person is in need of CPR and must be moved, move the person and begin CPR. Remember if you don't do CPR the person will die. The neck injury is only theoretical if you move the person. Death, if you don't do CPR, is 100% certain. Whenever you move a person with a possible neck injury try to support the head during movement and keep it as straight as possible.",heart
during the cpr what is the percentage of heart efficiency as a pump,The best estimate of the heart efficiency during CPR is 20-30% of normal.,heart
i heard that no matter if a person is unconscious that you should perform cpr is this true when should you not perform cpr,"It is true that sometimes a person may be unconscious and their heart is still beating and they may still be breathing. Such a situation, for example, may occur in someone who has just had a grand mal seizure. If you tried to do CPR on such a person he or she would probably groan and even try to push you away. This would be your clue that CPR was not needed. CPR is intended only for someone whose heart and breathing has stopped. If the victim moves or pushes you away, you should stop CPR.",heart
what is the ratio of 2person cpr,"The ratio of chest compressions to mouth-to-mouth is the same for 2 person CPR as for 1 person CPR, namely 30:2.",heart
how do i perform cpr on a person who has a tracheal stoma do i have to cover their mouth or just breath directly into the stoma,"There are two types of stomas, one which communicates to the nose and mouth and one which doesn't. Since you won't know which type you are dealing with, it is best to pinch the victim's nose closed, keep the victim's mouth closed and breathe directly into the stoma opening.",heart
when you are giving mouth to mouth are you actually breathing oxygen into the victims lungs or are you trying to stimulate breathing by breathing carbon dioxide into their lungs,You are breathing oxygen into the lungs. Your exhaled breath contains 16% oxygen which is close to the 20% contained in the air you breathe in.,heart
when performing cpr how do i know if its working,You can tell if the chest rises with ventilation. It is hard to determine if the chest compression results in a pulse. Do the best you can and don't stop. It's better to perform CPR imperfectly than not at all.,heart
if a person has had bypass surgery and a situation occurs that they require cpr are there any special considerations that need to be made,"No, CPR should be done in the regular fashion.",heart
is it easier to break an overweight persons ribs or a skinnier persons ribs when performing cpr,"The weight of the victim has little to do with the chances of breaking a rib, instead the age of the victim seems to determine the fragility of the bones.",heart
can i kill someone if i do cpr incorrectly,"No. Remember the person in cardiac arrest is already clinically dead. CPR can only help. Even if it's not done ""letter perfect"" it will probably provide some benefit to the victim.",heart
what if i crack a rib when i do cpr,"Frequently ribs are broken with the pressure CPR places on the sternum. Some studies quote up to 30% of cardiac arrest victims have broken ribs as a result of CPR. This happens more frequently the older the victim since the cartilage is less compliant and the bones more easily crackable. But remember, it's better to have a cracked rib than be dead.",heart
will cpr always save a life,"No, in fact, most instances of CPR for cardiac arrest are unsuccessful.",heart
what is the recovery position,"Assuming the person has a pulse and is breathing, the recovery position means placing the person on his or her side. This allows for the person not to choke on saliva and helps keep the airway open. The downside arm may be raised to suport the head.",heart
what should you do for a person who has been accidentally shocked by electricity,A person with electric shock (assuming the shock doesn't severely damage the body) often dies from the heart going into ventricular fibrillation. Such a person needs CPR and it should be performed in the regular fashion. If CPR begins quickly and if a defibrillator arrives quickly this person has an excellent chance of survival.,heart
i want to know what the current teachings are on helping a choking victim i have heard conflicting information on back blows for an adult is it still recommended or discouraged,The first action to take in adults and children is the Heimlich maneuver. Back blows are the first thing to do only in infants who are conscious. In doing the back blows the infant should be in a face down position with the head lower than the body.,heart
what if the victim vomits,Vomit is obviously unpleasant. If it happens (and it may in one out of 20 cardiac arrests) merely turn the head to the side and wipe out the vomit as best you can with your finger.,heart
if someone has an asthma attack and collapses what should a person do will cpr help,"If someone collapses from an asthma attack, it is because he or she is not getting enough oxygen. This is because all the lung's small airways have narrowed and are not allowing enough air to reach the air sacs. Mouth to mouth respiration may help a little. The real need is to get this person to an emergency department so that the patient can receive medications and emergency endotracheal intubation (a tube in the main airway).",heart
what are some of the causes of cpr being used for in infants and children,Usually CPR in infants and children is performed for respiratory arrest such as severe asthma. Ventricular fibrillation is rare in children but very common in older adults.,heart
in regards to administering the heimlich maneuver to a victim while they are lying down should the head be facing up as when administering cpr in order to clear the airway or to the side,The victim's head should be facing up with the victim on his her back. Since the airway is blocked you shouldn't spend much time positioning the head. The Heimlich maneuver is the most important thing to do and should unblock the airway,heart
what if the victim is wearing dentures,Keep them in place if possible as they will allow for a better seal of your mouth on his hers.,heart
can i get aids from doing cpr,No. There has never been a documented case of AIDS transmitted by CPR.,heart
can i get sued if i perform cpr,You theoretically could but there has never been a successful suit brought against someone performing CPR.,heart
does the good samaritan law protect me,"Yes, if you give assistance, including CPR, for a medical emergency Good Samaritan laws cover you.",heart
what are agonal respirations,"When the heart stops beating in cardiac arrest the breathing center in the brain is still alive for a couple of minutes and will cause the victim to take a few abnormal breaths. These abnormal breaths associated in dying are called agonal respirations. They may appear like snoring, gasping, or snorting and will disappear in a couple of minutes. Don't let abnormal breathing stop you from starting CPR.",heart
in cardiopulmonary arrest occurring outside of a hospital what are statistics regarding successful uncomplicated recovery also in this situation how many patients are successfully resuscitated but are then in a vegetative state,The statistics vary from locale to locale. In New York City or Chicago the survival rate (discharge alive from the hospital) is 2 or 3%. In Seattle the survival rate is 20% overall and 45% for ventricular fibrillation. Less than 5% of those discharged have severe neurologic damage. Over 60% return to their prior level of mental status. Persistent vegetative states are very unusual.,heart
can cpr be performed on dogs,"CPR can be performed on dogs. To give respiration you will need to keep the dogs mouth and lips closed and breathe through the nose. Cover the dogs nose completely with your mouth to prevent air from leaking out. You should see the chest rise if you are doing it properly. To give chest compressions you might need to press side to side instead of straight down on the chest. This is especially true for funnel chested dogs. The rates of respiration to chest compression are the same as for humans. In general, most instances of CPR for dogs will involve accidents of smoke inhalation or drowning. Respirations may indeed prove life saving especially if the dog has a heart beat. Once the dog's heart stops beating it is unlikely that CPR will be of benefit. By the way, the name gingy in my address is for my 13 year-old golden retriever.",heart
if a person moves when i do cpr should i stop,"Yes, if a person moves his arms or legs they don't need CPR.",heart
when should i stop cpr,"When help arrives to take over, or the victim starts to move.",heart
what chance does the person on whom i perform cpr have of surviving,If you do CPR on a person whose heart has stopped beating there is a 40% chance the person will live if a defibrillator can arrive within 10 minutes to shock the heart.,heart
what should i do if im alone and i do not know cpr,If you are alone and don't know how to do CPR call 911 and ask the emergency dispatcher to give you instructions over the phone.,heart
if a pregnant women chokes should i do the heimlich maneuver or can it harm the baby,You should do the chest thrust in a very pregnant woman. This is like the Heimlich except you grab around the middle chest instead of the upper abdomen. Click here for more info.,heart
what is the reason calling 911 occurs after 2 minutes of cpr for infants and children whereas for adults the call is made immediately,It is because airway problems are the main cause of cardiac arrest in infants and trying to correct that problem takes precedent over calling 911.,heart
if successful cpr is dependent on a defibrillator arriving are there any portable defibrillators available,Portable defibrillators which operate automatically (they are called automated external defibrillators - AEDs) are available and may be purchased without a prescription. They cost around 1000. The training is very simple and takes only minutes. You should talk to your doctor as to whether one of these might be indicated in your situation.,heart
in a trekking guidebook i own it states that if there has been a trauma fall and the victim has no pulse then cpr is futile is this true,"Doing CPR in the wilderness is futile. I would, however, make an attempt to open the airway and perhaps give several ventilations. You may be dealing with respiratory arrest and a little mouth to mouth could be lifesaving.",heart
is it true that if a victim regains a pulse after doing cpr heshe has probably had a pulse all along,You are partially correct. The most common cause of cardiac arrest is VF and this cannot be converted with CPR alone. Electricity is required. However there are some instances when the heart is going very slowly and CPR can oxygenate the system enough to get the heart going again.,heart
what is sudden cardiac arrest,"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is a life-threatening emergency that occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating. It strikes people of all ages who may seem to be healthy, even children and teens. When SCA happens, the person collapses and doesnt respond or breathe normally. They may gasp or shake as if having a seizure. SCA leads to death in minutes if the person does not get help right away. Survival depends on people nearby calling 911, starting CPR, and using an AED (if available) as soon as possible.CPR: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is when you push hard and fast on the center of chest to make the heart pump. Compressions may be given with or without rescue breaths.AED: Automated external defibrillator is a device that analyzes the heart and if it detects a problem may deliver a shock to restart the hearts normal rhythm.",heart
what causes sudden cardiac arrest,"SCA can result from cardiac causes (abnormalities of the heart muscle or the hearts electrical system), external causes (drowning, trauma, asphyxia, electrocution, drug overdose, blows to the chest), and other medical causes such as inflammation of the heart muscle due to infection. Most SCAs are caused by an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia). The most common life-threatening arrhythmia is ventricular fibrillation, which is an erratic, disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles (the hearts lower chambers). When this occurs, the heart is unable to pump blood and death will occur within minutes if left untreated. Heart attacks can also lead to SCA.",heart
what are the signs and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest,"Usually, the first sign of SCA is loss of consciousness (fainting). Typically, the person collapses and doesnt respond or breathe normally. They may gasp or shake as if having a seizure.",heart
how common is sudden cardiac arrest,"SCA is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. It affects about 1,000 people outside hospital settings every day. Unfortunately, only one in 10 victims survive.",heart
does sudden cardiac arrest mostly affect the elderly,"No. While the average SCA victim is about 60-years-old, SCA affects people of all ageseven children and teens. Thousands of youth under the age of 18 experience SCA each year in the U.S.",heart
is sudden cardiac arrest the same as a heart attack,"No. SCA is an electrical problem in the heart. When people have SCA, they are not awake, their hearts are not beating, and they are unable to communicate. Symptoms of SCA include sudden loss of responsiveness and absence of normal breathing.In contrast, a heart attack is a circulatory problem in the heart. When people have heart attacks, they are awake, their hearts are beating, and they are able to communicate. Symptoms of heart attack can include chest discomfort; pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach; shortness of breath; sweating; nausea; and lightheadedness. Heart attacks can lead to SCA, but there also are many other causes.",heart
where does sudden cardiac arrest typically occur,"When SCA happens outside a hospital setting, it occurs most often in a home or residence, followed by public settings and nursing homes. About 7 in 10 events occur in home settings.",heart
who is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest,"Risk factors for SCA include:Low ejection fraction or weak heart musclePrior heart attack Heart failureAbnormal heart rate or heart rhythm (arrhythmia)Family history of arrhythmiaFamily history of sudden cardiac death Congenital heart defectsHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a thickened heart muscle that especially affects the ventricles)Viral infection in the heartHistory of syncope (fainting) Coronary artery disease (CAD) and risk factors for CAD, including smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyleSignificant changes in blood levels of potassium and magnesium (e.g., from using diuretics)Recreational drug use.",heart
what is the ejection fraction,"Ejection fraction (EF) refers to how well the heart is pumping. It's the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the hearts main pumping chamber during each heartbeat. If the EF is low (35% or lower), the person is at increased risk for sudden cardiac death. It is important to know that the EF can change over time.",heart
does sudden cardiac arrest mostly affect people with a history of heart problems,No. SCA often is the first indication of a heart problem.,heart
what causes sudden cardiac arrest in young people,"While there are a number of possible causes, there are three common causes. One cause is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), a congenital heart muscle disease in which the walls of the hearts left ventricle become abnormally thickened. The structural abnormality can lead to obstruction of blood flow from the heart, causing loss of consciousness and an irregular heartbeat, leading to SCA. Another cause, Long QT syndrome, is an often-unrecognized congenital condition that predisposes the child to an abnormality in the hearts electrical system that can lead to SCA. Episodes are most commonly triggered by physical exertion or emotional stress. Finally, commotio cordis is an electrical disturbance caused by a blow to the chest. It occurs most often in baseball, but has been reported in other sports and situations in which there is a blow to the chest.",heart
how can sudden cardiac arrest be prevented,"Living a healthy lifestyleexercising regularly, eating healthy foods, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smokingcan help prevent SCA. Monitoring and controlling blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes is also important. If there is a family history of SCA, it is important to be checked by a cardiologist or electrocardiologist. If abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are detected, they can be treated through implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy, use of medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, and catheter ablation. Some patients, especially those who have had previous heart attacks, may benefit from the use of wearable cardioverter defibrillators (WCDs).",heart
what about heart screening eg for student athletes,Coming soon!,heart
what is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator,"An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a battery-powered device placed under the skin to monitor the heart rate. If an abnormal heart rhythm is detected (i.e., the heart is beating chaotically or too fast), the device will deliver a shock to restore a normal heartbeat. ICDs can prevent cardiac arrest in high-risk patients.",heart
what is a wearable cardioverter defibrillator,"A wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) is prescribed for patients at risk of SCA. It consists of a garment, an electrode belt, and a monitor. While some defibrillator devices are implanted under the skin, the wearable defibrillator is worn under the clothes, directly against the patients skin. ",heart
how should sudden cardiac arrest be treated,"SCA is treatable most of the timeespecially when it is due to an electrical abnormality called ventricular fibrillationas long as it is treated quickly. Treatment includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of defibrillators. This treatment must be provided immediately to be effective, ideally within three to five minutes after collapse. Even the fastest emergency medical services may not be able to reach a victim this quickly. That is why prompt action by bystanders is critical and why it is so important that more laypersons learn CPR and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED). Laypersons should be prepared to recognize the emergency, call 911, give CPR and use the nearest AED. If the person is not responsive and not breathing normally, one should suspect SCA and start CPR. This has been called the ""No-No-Go"" protocol. When a person suffers cardiac arrest, he or she is clinically dead, but life can often be restored with immediate bystander action.Subsequent care includes administration of medications and other advanced cardiac life support techniques by emergency medical personnel. Patients who have been successfully resuscitated but remain in a coma after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) may benefit from mild therapeutic hypothermia (cooling), which can improve the chances of survival with good brain function. SCA survivors should see heart specialists (cardiologists and electrophysiologists) for follow-up care.",heart
what is cpr,"CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, involves pushing on the center of the chest (between the nipples) hard and fast (100-120 pumps per minute) to circulate oxygenated blood already in the body to the brain and other organs. ",heart
what is an aed,"An AED, or automated external defibrillator, is a device that automatically analyzes heart rhythms and advises the operator to deliver a shock if the heart is in a fatal heart rhythm. It is designed for use by untrained bystanders. AEDs are safe and cannot hurt the victim.",heart
is there anything a bystander can do to help save a life threatened by sudden cardiac arrest,"Yes. The chances of survival from SCA increase dramatically if the victim receives immediate CPR and treatment with an automated external defibrillator (AED). AEDs are designed for use by laypersons and provide visual and voice prompts. They will not shock the heart unless shocks are needed to restore a healthy heartbeat. Bystander intervention with CPR and AEDs can greatly improve the likelihood of survival. In fact, if bystanders use AEDs before EMS arrival, survival rates can be as high as 50%.",heart
how does an aed work,"A computer inside the AED analyzes the victims heart rhythm. The device determines whether a shock is needed. Some devices shock the victim automatically if a shock is needed. Other devices require that the operator press a button to deliver the shock. The shock is delivered through pads applied to the victims bare chest. The shock stuns the heart, stopping abnormal heart activity and allowing a normal heart rhythm to resume.",heart
who can use an aed,"An AED is designed for use by any bystander, regardless of training. The AED uses voice and visual prompts to advise the user how to apply electrode pads and whether or not to administer a shock. Some devices shock automatically if the victim has a fatal heart rhythm. Training is recommended since many victims also need CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). ",heart
can i accidentally hurt the victim with an aed,No. Most SCA victims will die if they are not treated immediately. Your actions can only help. AEDs are designed in such a way that they will only shock victims who need to be shocked.,heart
can i hurt myself or others with an aed,"No, not if you use it properly. The electric shock is programmed to go from one pad to the other through the victim's chest. Basic precautions, such as not touching the victim during the shock, ensure the safety of rescuers and bystanders.",heart
can the aed be used safely if the victim is on a metal surface such as a bleacher or stretcher,Yes. AEDs can be used safely as long as the electrode pads do not come into contact with the metal surface.,heart
are there special considerations when placing electrodes on a female victim,"If the victim is wearing a bra, remove it before placing electrode pads.",heart
what if the victim has a medication patch such as nitroglycerin,"Never place AED electrode pads directly on top of medication patches. If the patch is in the way of the AED pads, remove it and wipe off the area with the victim's shirt. Do not touch the patch with bare skin. Then apply the pads to the clean, bare skin. ",heart
what if the victim has an implantable pacemaker or defibrillator,"If the victim has an implantable pacemaker or defibrillator with a battery pack (visible as a lump under the skin), avoid placing the pad directly on top of the implanted medical device.",heart
do aeds always help sca victims,AEDs are designed to treat victims in SCA with an irregular heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF). AEDs work best in these victims if they are used quickly and if the victim has received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).,heart
what is the difference between aeds and defibrillators commonly used on ambulances in hospitals and on tv,"Defibrillators sometimes used on ambulances and in hospitals, and often seen on TV, are manual defibrillators. They are larger than AEDs and are designed to be used by medical personnel with special training. In contrast, AEDs are smaller, computerized devices designed so that virtually any operator can use them by simply following the audio and visual prompts. ",heart
where should aeds be located,"Logical locations for AED placement include police cars, airports, train, bus and subway stations, highway rest stops, sports arenas, doctor and dentist offices, health clinics, fitness clubs, shopping malls, large grocery stores, theatres, workplaces, schools, churches and retirement communities. Research has shown some of the best locations for AED placement are in 24-hour coffee shops or near ATMs. Increasingly, consumers are choosing to purchase AEDs for their homes and vehicles, since most SCAs outside hospital settings occur in home settings.",heart
do i need to have a prescription to acquire an aed,"A prescription from a physician is required for purchasing some AED models. However, at least one model has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for use without a prescription and is available over the counter. ",heart
do aeds replace the use of cpr,No. CPR is critical until the AED arrives at the scene. High-quality CPR can greatly improve the chances of survival.,heart
should i have an aed in my home,"People who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. Regardless of known risk, since seven out of 10 SCAs occur at home, placing these devices in homes could save many lives.",heart
do bystanders who provide care need to be concerned about liability risks,"No. A person who has suffered Sudden Cardiac Arrest is clinically dead. It is not possible to cause further injury by performing CPR or using an AED. The federal Cardiac Arrest Survival Act and state Good Samaritan laws are designed to protect laypersons from legal liability risk. Although laws vary from state to state, they generally encourage bystanders and the lay public to perform CPR and to use an AED. Depending on state law, the categories of people who are given protection include the lay public and sometimes first responders and medical professionals. Depending on state law, protection is granted unless the responder is negligent (fails to provide reasonable care), or grossly negligent (acts with a conscious disregard for the safety of the victim).",heart
who survives sudden cardiac arrest,"About one in 10 EMS-treated SCA victims survives. However, there are large regional variations in survival to hospital discharge, which are largely due to bystander intervention with CPR and AEDs. When bystanders give CPR, survival rates can triple. When bystanders give CPR and use AEDs, survival rates can be as high as 50%.",heart
what is therapeutic hypothermia,"Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is considered an important therapy for a comatose survivor of cardiac arresta patient whose heart stopped beating, was restarted during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and who remains minimally responsive immediately after the event. It is endorsed by the American Heart Association and is performed by lowering the body temperature to 32-34C (approximately 90 to 93F). Normal body temperature is 98.6 F or 37C. TH works by protecting the brain and other vital organs. It lowers oxygen requirements, decreases swelling, and limits the release of toxins, which can cause cells to die. TH has been shown to improve neurological outcomes and increase survival in patients who remain in a coma after successful CPR.",heart
after resuscitation will the survivor be able to resume a normal life,Most people who survive SCA can return to their previous level of functioning. All survivors need follow-up care with physicians who specialize in heart conditions (cardiologists and electrophysiologists).,heart
do survivors of cardiac arrest experience any complications,"Some survivors of cardiac arrest experience medical problems, including impaired consciousness and cognitive deficits. Functional recovery continues over the first six to 12 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults. It is common for survivors to have memory loss and to experience depression and anxiety for some time after their event.",heart
 four quick steps to save a the life of a person who has just suffered cardiac arrest,"STEP 1: Identify if it actually is a cardiac arrest. Tap on collapsed victim's both shoulders a few times and ask loudly if he is ok. If there is noresponse from the victim either by taps or sound, check for breathing by placing the palm ofyour hand over the abdomen for about 10 seconds. If you do not feel the abdomen rise up anddown, the victim is not breathing for sure. Therefore, if there is no response and no breathing,it should be assumed that the victim has just suffered a cardiac arrest.(NOTE: PERFORM THE NEXT 3 STEPS ONLY IF THE PERSON IS NOT RESPONSIVE OR NOTBREATHING.)STEP 2: Once confirmed it is cardiac arrest, dial 108 call for a CARDIAC AMBULANCE andan AED (if nearby).STEP 3: Begin CPR immediately.Make sure the victim is lying on his back on a firm surface (like the floor).Quickly position yourself either on the left or the right side of the victim, place theheel of your hand over the middle of the victims chest (between the nipples) and interlockyour fingers.Give 100 to 120 chest compressions per minute. Count.Keep providing chest compressions at the depth of 5 cms until the AED or emergencyservices arrive.STEP 4: If an AED is available place its pads over the victim's body as indicated by thepads and follow its prompts. ",heart
 what is cprccr,"Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) or Cardio-Cerebral Resuscitation (CCR), also known asheart massage or chest compressions, is an emergency procedure that focuses on chestcompressions in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures aretaken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiacarrest.The purpose of CPR is to keep oxygenated blood flowing around the body to keep the vital organsalive, especially the brain. CPR itself may not restart a victim's heart, it just keeps himalive until AED shocks are administered. An AED is a device that delivers an electrical shock tothe heart to restart it.When should I begin CPR and when should I stop it?You should begin CPR only if:The victim has collapsed either in the last few minutes or in front of you and if that victim isNOT breathing. Remember, CPR should NOT be performed on a person who is breathing.You should stop providing CPR ONLY IF:If the victim shows signs of life like finger movements, eye movements, coughing etc.If you are asked to stop by a professional healthcare professional (ambulance crew etc).If you become too exhausted to continue, ask the other bystander to watch how you areproviding the chest compressions and do exactly, as soon as you stop and then take over oncethat bystander gets exhausted. Continue with this cycle.",heart
 what is an aed,"An AED (Automated External Defibrillator) is a lightweight, battery-operated, sophisticated,portable yet easy-to-use, medical device that can analyze the heart's rhythm and, if necessary,deliver a measured electrical current to help the heart re-establish an effective rhythm.AEDs are used to treat sudden cardiac arrests (SCA) and are made to be used by public in diresituations.",heart
 what is the procedure to use an aed machine,"An AED is to be used ONLY on a collapsed person who's become un-responsive to either touch orsound; is showing no sign of a pulse and is not breathing, whereupon its safe to presume thatthe person has just suffered a cardiac arrest. Before using the AED, move him or her to a dryarea if the area of collapse is wet, and stay away from wetness when delivering shocks.Turn on the AED's power if its not auto-start. The device will give you step-by-stepinstructions.Expose the person's chest. If the person's chest is wet, dry it (dry only the areas where thepads are to be attached, not the entire body). AEDs have sticky pads with sensors calledelectrodes. Apply the pads to the person's bare chest as pictured on the pads themselves byindicative red arrows.If the person has a lot of chest hair, you may have to trim it with the pair of scissorsusually provided in the AED box. (Move the AED pads at least 1 inch away from implanted devicesor piercings so the current can flow freely between the pads.) Make sure no one is touching thevictim when the shock is about to be delivered.If a shock is required to be provided, the AED will let you know when to deliver it by flashingthe indicative button. Push the AED's ""shock"" button for the actual shock to be provided. Startor resume CPR until emergency medical help arrives or until the person begins to breathe. Staywith the person until medical help arrives, and report all information you know about what hashappened.",heart
 can aeds be safely used,"Yes. AEDs are specifically designed to be used by non-medical, untrained bystanders. However,it is preferable that they are operated by volunteers who have completed the CPR, AED trainingprogramme.",heart
 how much jolt is administered by an aed  can an actual electric shock be given to the victim,Some AEDs deliver a higher dose of electricity (360 joules-monophasic AED) while others delivera lower maximum dose (150 or 200 joules-Biphasic AED).DO NOT provide an actual electric shock from an electrical output wire to the victim underany circumstances. The AED provides jolts that are calculative and measured.,heart
 how many shocks should be given to a victim of a cardiac arrest and for how long,"The decision of how many shocks are needed to be administered is best left to an AED machine todecide. The automated machine examines the rhythm of the heart and decides accordingly whether ashock is required to be provided, of what measure and how many. Strictly follow AED prompts.",heart
 should cpr be continued after an aed shock has been administered if the victim has not revived,Yes. Until emergency service arrives. The attached AED prompts when it is safe to touch thevictim and when CPR shoud continue and when it must stop (so another shock may be delivered).,heart
 can the aed pads be attached over the victims clothes,"No. The pads must be attached on dry, bare skin only and in the manner indicated in the pictureon the pads or as the AED intructs.",heart
 how much does an aed cost and where can i buy it from if i want to install it in my society or office,"AED machines are sold by various different brands and therefore come with different costs. Youmay do an internet search for manufacturers to buy from, in your city.NOTE: iCARE DOES NOT SELL AEDs.",heart
 locations of available aeds in mumbai installed bywith help of project icare,"For all AED locations, kindly click on the option 'AED Locations' in the main website menu ontop.REMEMBER: In case of an emergency, please rush to the nearest location from theaddresses provided and pick the AED without hesitation. In case a secuity guard inquires,quickly let him know where and why you are taking it or ask him to accompany you.",heart
 is there a difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest,"Yes, there is a difference. Heart attack and Cardiac arrest are not one and the same as isusually thought of generally. People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are notsynonyms. A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching a sectionof the heart. If the blocked artery is not reopened quickly, the part of the heart normallynourished by that artery begins to die.Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by anelectrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat. With its pumping actiondisrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, aperson loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does notreceive treatment.Basic difference - In a Heart attack, the victim is still breathing but in a Cardiacarrest, the victim stops breathing.What should I do when its a Heart Attack?Call 108 (in India) or a Cardiac Ambulance immediately or rush the victim to the nearesthospital immediately.What should I do when its Sudden Cardiac Arrest?Sudden Cardiac arrest is reversible in most victims if it's treated within a few minutes. First,check if the victim is responsive and breathing. If not, call for a Cardiac Ambulance andan AED (if available nearby) and begin CCR immediately and continue until professional emergencymedical services arrive. If two people are available to help, one should provide and continue withCCR on the victim while the other should call for a cardiac ambulance of the nearest hospital andfind an AED. Administer the AED on the victim. ",heart
 what if its not cardiac arrest,"If the person is responsive in movement of any kind or is still breathing regularly, it is nota cardiac arrest. Nevertheless, either rush him to the hospital or call for an ambulance, makesure nobody is crowding the victim and monitor him until emergency services arrive.",heart
 what if the cardiac arrest victim is a female,"The victim, regardless gender, must be treated with the same procedure for both CCR and AED. Toattach AED pads, use a cloth if available for modesty to cover her chest area or use a pair ofscissors (found in the AED box) to cut open the parts of the clothing where the pads need to beattached. Attach the pads on her dry, bare skin and perform procedure as required.",heart
 what if the victim has collapsed at a hard to reach place that looks dangerous like rocks hill side,Ensure your safety first. Do not fall victim to circumstances yourself. Call for police andemergency if you cannot reach the victim yourself and then follow procedure.,heart
 what if an aed is not available,Continue CCR until emergency services arrive. Keep monitoring the victim.,heart

what are the warning signs of heart disease,"Heart disease can manifest as chest pain, tightness, or discomfort. Sometimes even shortness of breath can be a symptom of a heart attack. Any unusual restriction in your activity could be a warning sign of heart disease. Dizziness or a fast or irregular heartbeat are other possible symptoms.",heart
is heart disease an irreversible condition,"Heart disease is potentially reversible by attending to risk factors like cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking. Several studies have shown, for example, that aggressive lowering of blood cholesterol with LDL levels below 100 can open up blocked coronary arteries at least partially. LDL cholesterol is the bad cholesterol component.",heart
is heart disease hereditary,"There is an increase in the risk of heart attack if a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) has had a heart attack or stroke. That is mainly seen when the relative has had a heart attack before the age of 45 if they are male, 55 if they are female. Obviously, you cannot change your family history, but a positive history should suggest the need to improve all the other risk factors like stopping smoking and decreasing cholesterol.If you have a family history of heart disease, it is wise to have your blood cholesterol checked after the age of 18 and regularly thereafter. The patient should also have their blood pressure checked annually as well as tests for diabetes. Perhaps more importantly, one should maintain a healthy lifestyle at any age. That includes no cigarettes, a heart-healthy diet, and regular exercise.",heart
does smoking increase your risk of heart disease,"Smoking is a major risk for several diseases including heart disease, stroke, and several cancers. Even low-tar cigarettes and light smoking can increase the risk of heart disease substantially. There are now several alternative approaches to helping people stop smoking. These include nicotine-replacement patches and gum as well as oral medication.",heart
is hypothyroidism a risk factor,"Hypothyroidism can increase blood cholesterol levels and that contributes to heart disease; however, if the hypothyroidism is being treated with a thyroid hormone, then the cholesterol returns to normal.",heart
are birth control pills a contributor to heart disease,Birth control pills can cause a small increase in the risk of thrombosis and heart attack. That occurs mainly in people who have been on the pill for more than 10 years and who smoke cigarettes.,heart
does being overweight increase the risk of heart disease,"Being overweight can increase the risk of heart disease in several ways. There can be a ten-fold increase in risks of high blood pressure and diabetes. In addition, being overweight will decrease the HDL or good cholesterol, which is now recognized as a major risk factor. If you are overweight, it is important to diet and exercise in order to lose weight and reduce these risk factors.Consider a diet that is balanced among all the main food groups, with fat content making up no more than 30 percent of calories and most of that fat being unsaturated. Avoid a diet that restricts carbohydrates or fruits and vegetables, because this may adversely affect vitamin intake and blood cholesterol.Red meat contains a lot of saturated fat. If you eat red meat every day, it is likely that your cholesterol is about 10-20 percent higher than it should be. Alternatives to red meat include chicken, fish, and turkey, as well as nonmeat protein sources like nuts and beans.It usually takes two to four weeks for a change in diet to start to influence cholesterol levels. However, the full effect of a change in diet may not be seen for up to three months.",heart
is salt bad for your heart,"Salt in the diet can cause an increase in blood pressure in some patients. For that reason doctors usually recommend that salt intake be restricted to moderate levels. It is particularly important to watch salt intake if a patient has high blood pressure that is not controlled with usual therapy. Many foods, such as potato chips, peanuts, and ready-made meals, have very high salt content.",heart
how important is diabetes as a risk factor,"The importance of diabetes is often underestimated. Studies have shown that if a patient has diabetes, their risk of a heart attack is increased five-fold above a patient who does not have diabetes. In addition, treating blood pressure and cholesterol in diabetic patients can dramatically reduce the risk of heart disease. For that reason it is very important that patients with diabetes have their blood pressure and cholesterol values checked frequently and are treated appropriately.",heart
can stress cause heart disease,"Stress can increase the risk of heart disease, although we still do not know how this happens. A sudden physical or emotional stress can certainly lead to an episode of angina or even a heart attack.",heart
how is heart disease related to strokes,"Heart disease is commonly caused by atherosclerosis (hardening and blockage of the arteries), and this process can also cause strokes. Most strokes are due to a blood clot that forms either in the brain or travels from a narrowed artery in the neck. We know that treating risk factors for atherosclerosis can reduce both heart attacks and stroke. For example, cholesterol lowering can reduce the risk of a stroke by about 25 percent.",heart
what happens if heart disease is left untreated ,"If heart disease is not treated, it can cause severe angina, heart failure with shortness of breath on even mild activities. The risk of death is increased. Most physicians are now very familiar with treating heart disease, so it does not often go untreated.",heart
will taking an aspirin a day reduce the risk of heart disease,"Aspirin may be helpful for patients who have already had a heart attack, stroke, atherosclerosis in other blood vessels, or who have diabetes or well-controlled hypertension. Aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by about 25 percent when taken in a dose of 325 mg or less a day. However, even low doses of aspirin can cause a slight increase in the risk of bleeding into the brain. For that reason, it is usually not recommended for low-risk patients who have not yet had a heart attack or stroke.",heart
is it true that a glass of red wine is good for your heart,"There is information that having one or two drinks per day can reduce the risk of heart attack. This may be because wine drinking or alcohol in general increases the level of good cholesterol, or HDL. However, this applies only to moderate intake of alcohol. The benefit is lost at higher levels of drinking. The benefit is not restricted to red wine; the data would suggest any kind of alcohol-containing drink might have some cardiac benefit.",heart
can exercise really make your heart stronger,"Exercise has huge benefits. It reduces blood pressure and increases HDL, or good cholesterol. It improves the number of blood vessels in the heart and in the rest of the body. So exercise makes it less likely that you will have a heart attack and if you do have a heart attack, it's likely that it will be less severe. In addition, exercise is a very important component of any weight-loss program.",heart
whom should i consult when i suspect of having symptoms of heart attack,You should consult with a cardiologist.,heart
what are the major risk factors for heart disease,"The major risk factors for heart disease are smoking, high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, age, gender, and heredity (including race).",heart
are women as prone to heart disease as men,There is a myth that women aren't as prone to heart disease as men. This is not true. Women account for nearly half of all heart attack deaths.,heart
how do i differentiate an anginal pain from a pain caused by heart attack,"Angina is a recurring pain or discomfort in the chest that happens when some part of the heart does not receive enough blood temporarily. A person may notice it during exertion, but is usually relieved within a few minutes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medicine. However, the symptoms of heart attack last longer and are not relieved by rest or pain medications.",heart
what are various tests available to detect heart attacks,"Electrocardiograms, blood tests, coronary angiography, cardiac catheterization, echocardiogram, stress tests, and MSCT angiogram can all help in diagnosis of heart attack.",heart
what are treatment options available to treat heart attack,"The treatment options include medications, angioplasty and stent placement, atherectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting. The choice of treatment will depend on the extent of the disease.",heart
once after having a heart attack and receiving treatment will i get another attack,"Having had a treatment for heart attack does not mean that you will never have another heart attack, but certain lifestyle modifications and preventive steps taken will help reduce the risk of another attack.",heart
what are preventive measures that will help reduce the risk of heart attacks,"Lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, limiting the intake of alcohol, having a balanced diet, regular exercise and treatment of underlying conditions that increase risk of heart attack with proper medications can all help in preventing heart attacks.",heart
which doctor will help if there is cardiac arrest,All doctors are trained for CPR in the event of cardiac arrest. Normally an intensive care doctor or a cardiologist will look after the patients once they are admitted to the hospitals.,heart
how long does cardiopulmonary resuscitation of cpr continue,"This will depend on the cause of cardiac arrest, if known. It can vary from 10 minutes to 45 minutes.",heart
what is the prognosis for cardiac arrest,"Outside of a hospital setting, the chance of surviving a cardiac arrest is 7.6%. This percentage increases to 22% when the patient is already in a hospital setting mainly due to instant care.The chances of survival are usually assessed at 72 hours or more after the arrest.",heart
what are the chances of brain damage after cardiac arrest,Brain damage due to loss of blood supply and hypoxia is a leading cause of disability after cardiac arrest. If the blood circulation to the brain is not re-established in 6 to 10 minutes there can be permanent brain damage.,heart
are there any methods to prevent brain injury after cardiac arrests,"Cooling the body or hypothermia is one way of protecting the brain, however this requires to be in a hospital that has this facility.",heart
