## Problem Statement/Opportunity

- Proper knowledge of the disease, causes l, it's symptoms, what are the necessary steps that's needs to be taken etc are not able to reach to people.The information are scattered in the internet about not in a single place. So, this chatbot will help in answering the users most of the queries related to disease like covid, diabetes, heart attack etc and other information related to fitness and nutrition.
- There are many opportunities to explore, and I will learn about Azure ML studio, hosting services, azure environment, integration and deployment

## Project Description

Natural Learning Processing is a burning topic in present era. To play with textual data is the core idea of this project. I am creating a chatbot for medical health related information provider.

- It will provide the information about the disease, it's cause, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and precautions needs to be taken etc.

- Used Azure Machine Learning Studio for Data preparation, Data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis and Model building with Azure jupyter Notebook creating computer resource.

- Used Web App for deployment from github repository.

- The project starts with data extraction using selenium Webdriver in python. After that the data is dump into json file.

- The next process starts with data cleaning and preprocessing using python libraries like nltk , pandas , numpy, matplotlib etc. 

- Create intent for the dataset and built a model for intent classification. Used SVM classifier which provide an accuracy score of 87%.

- Based on the intent, using cosine similarity find the most similar query and output the answer form the cleaned dataset. 
- If the user is not satisfied with the answer provide the top five most similar questions.
